Over three quarters of heart disease and stroke-related deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries. Hypertension – or elevated blood pressure – is a serious medical condition that significantly increases the risk of heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. Hypertension can be defined using specific systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels or reported use of antihypertensive medications. An estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide have high blood pressure, but just 14% have it under control. However, cost-effective treatment options do exist. In this guideline, the World Health Organization (WHO) provides the most current and relevant evidence-based global public health guidance on the initiation of treatment with pharmacological agents for hypertension in adults. The recommendations target adult, non-pregnant patients who were appropriately diagnosed with hypertension and counselled about life-style modifications. The guideline provides new recommendations on the threshold for the initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension, as well as recommendations on intervals for follow up, target blood pressure to be achieved for control, and the cadre of health care workers who may initiate treatment. The guideline provides the basis for deciding whether to initiate treatment with monotherapy, dual therapy or single-pill combinations, as well as guidance for countries selecting medicines and algorithms for hypertension control for their national guidelines for hypertension management. The guideline was developed in accordance with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development. In brief, the WHO Steering Group, in collaboration with the Guideline Development Group, developed key questions and rated outcomes to identify those critical for the development of the guideline. Conflicts of interest were handled in line with the current Compliance, Risk Management and Ethics (CRE) policy and all members of the GDG were asked to fill in the standard WHO Declaration of Interest (DOI) forms, which were reviewed. An overview of systematic reviews of the evidence was used to build summary of findings tables according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. The Guideline Development Group developed recommendations, considering the certainty of the evidence; the balance between desirable and undesirable effects; resource requirements and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, patient values and preferences, and feasibility.

Over three quarters of heart disease and stroke-related deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries (1). Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of the body’s arteries, the major blood vessels in the body. Blood pressure is written as two numbers. The first number (systolic) represents the pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts or beats. The second number (diastolic) represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart rests between beats. Hypertension – or elevated blood pressure – is a serious medical condition that significantly increases the risk of diseases of the heart, brain, kidneys and other organs (2). Hypertension can be defined using specific systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels or reported use of antihypertensive medications. An estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide have high blood pressure, but just 14% have it under control (2). However, cost-effective treatment options do exist. A World Health Organization (WHO) guideline dealing specifically with raised blood pressure was last published more than 20 years ago – in 1999 – and is now outdated. In 2007, a comprehensive guideline on cardiovascular risk included some recommendations on hypertension but this also needs revision and updating in the light of new evidence and practice (3). Guidance is particularly needed on some controversial issues, such as when to start treatment and whether laboratory testing and cardiovascular risk assessment are needed prior to starting treatment. In the past decade, WHO has included diagnosis and management of hypertension in a total cardiovascular risk approach as part of the WHO package of essential noncommunicable disease (NCD) Interventions (WHO PEN) 2007, 2010 and 2013. However, this approach has not included the most recent advances in pharmacological treatment. The WHO Essential Medicines List (EML) identifies all classes of antihypertensive drugs – angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and thiazide diuretics – as essential. In June 2019, the EML included single-pill combination medications for hypertension. This further supports the evaluation of all classes of antihypertensive drugs as well as single-pill combinations in this current guideline.

In June 2019, the EML included single-pill combination medications for hypertension. This further supports the evaluation of all classes of antihypertensive drugs as well as single-pill combinations in this current guideline. Scope and objectives of the hypertension guideline The 2021 WHO hypertension guideline aims to provide the most current and relevant evidence- based global public health guidance on the initiation of treatment (with pharmacological agents) for hypertension in adults. The recommendations target the general adult, non-pregnant, hypertensive population. Although several countries and professional societies have guidelines on the topic of hypertension, these are specific to the population of that particular country or the specific setting or constituency of the professional society. Recent shifts in hypertension management, such as moving away from using beta-blockers as a first-line agent or the increased research and adoption of combination therapies and single-pill combinations, are all additional reasons for new guidance. The Guideline for the pharmacological treatment of hypertension in adults will be the first global guideline in the past two decades on the topic and will have specific relevance to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The guideline provides new recommendations on the threshold for the initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension, recommendations on intervals for follow up, target blood pressure to be achieved for control, and the cadre of health care workers who may initiate treatment. It provides the basis for deciding whether to initiate treatment with monotherapy, dual therapy, or single-pill combination, as well as guidance for countries on selecting medicines for hypertension control in their national guidelines for hypertension management. NOITCUDORTNI 1 This guideline will replace the guidance in the modules Evidence-based protocols and Risk-based CVD management of the HEARTS technical package, as well as the guidance in the WHO PEN package regarding the threshold for initiation of treatment, and for the preferred pharmacological treatment for hypertension. The guideline does not address measurement of blood pressure or diagnosis of hypertension. It addresses pharmacotherapy in individuals with a “confirmed” diagnosis of hypertension, such as hypertension diagnosed when blood pressure is found to be elevated on two different days. Although this guideline does not address modifiable risk factors for hypertension such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese, a comprehensive treatment plan for hypertension must include addressing these risk factors through life- style modifications and other interventions (2). Nonpharmacological approaches to treatment or prevention of hypertension include: [ reducing salt intake (to less than 5g daily) [ eating more fruit and vegetables [ being physically active on a regular basis [ avoiding use of tobacco [ reducing alcohol consumption [ limiting the intake of foods high in saturated fats [ eliminating/reducing trans fats in diet (2).

An internal WHO Steering Group to coordinate the guideline development process. 2. A Guideline Development Group (GDG), composed of hypertension (HTN) physicians, nephrologists, cardiologists, pharmacists, nurses, researchers, academics, policy-makers and representatives of patient groups, to review the evidence and develop recommendations. WHO selected the members of the GDG based on relevant expertise but it also considered appropriate representation by region and sex. 3. An External Review Group (ERG), composed of technical experts, representatives of HTN patient groups and ministries of health from low-resource countries, to provide peer review of the guideline and ensure recommendations are aligned with current global needs. Annex 1 lists the contributors in each group. Annex 2 describes the process for declaring and managing conflicts of interest. 2.2 Analytical framework and PICOs An initial GDG meeting was held in Geneva in July 2019 to determine the scope and PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions of the guideline. The GDG first developed an analytical framework (Fig. 1) that demonstrates the impact of interventions on intermediate and final outcomes and displays the order of the key questions to better visualize and place them along the patient-flow pathway. Following this, and a preliminary scoping review and discussion between the steering group and methodologist, PICO questions were developed. These were considered, deliberated on, further refined and voted on during the meeting.

ENILEDIUG EHT GNIPOLEVED ROF DOHTEM 3 2.3 Outcome importance rating Members of the WHO Steering Group, in consultation with the GDG and methodologist, developed a list of treatment outcomes most relevant to the care of individuals with HTN. The GDG then rated each outcome on a scale from 1 to 9 and indicated whether it considered each outcome critical (rated 7–9), important (rated 4–6) or not important (rated 1–3) for decision-making. The mean scores are provided in Annex 3. 2.4 Reviews of evidence The WHO Steering Group, with the participation of the GDG, determined the scope of the guideline and identified eleven questions in the format of population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) to guide the search for systematic reviews (Annex 4). Eleven overviews of reviews informed the guideline development process. A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos to identify existing systematic reviews that answered the PICO questions published in 2015 or after. Suitable systematic reviews were then evaluated based on the following criteria: [ their methodology as appraised by the AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) tool; [ how directly they matched the PICO questions; [ whether they reported sufficient information to allow for an assessment of the certainty of the evidence (e.g. tables with characteristics of included studies, risk of bias assessments at the study level, results of meta analyses in forest plots); [ whether they reported evidence in subgroups of interest (e.g. patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) etc); and [ the date of the most recent review to ensure the most updated evidence was used. The Systematic Review Team prioritized the most useful reviews for each question, comparison, outcome and subpopulation within questions, and included as many reviews as necessary to address each question comprehensively. (Web Annex A provides details of the search terms and strategy used.) No reviews were updated. Two questions (PICO 2 and 10, see Annex 4) were not addressed", "page_start": 15, "page_end": 16, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789240033986-eng.pdf"}

The Systematic Review Team prioritized the most useful reviews for each question, comparison, outcome and subpopulation within questions, and included as many reviews as necessary to address each question comprehensively. (Web Annex A provides details of the search terms and strategy used.) No reviews were updated. Two questions (PICO 2 and 10, see Annex 4) were not addressed in an existing systematic review, and evidence from primary studies was therefore used. In this case, the Systematic Review Team reviewed the list of studies used in existing guidelines, queried the GDG and content experts, and searched for primary studies. A total of 159 systematic reviews and 17 additional primary studies were included. Most of these were traditional systematic reviews in which the authors conducted pairwise meta-analysis, whereas nine analysed individual patient data. The Systematic Review Team also identified several published network meta-analyses. (See Web Annex A for full details.) Most of the included reviews were found to be of high certainty when assessed using the AMSTAR tool. Details of the selection process, and the reviews and studies included for each PICO question, are presented in Web Annex A. Another overview of reviews was conducted to identify systematic reviews to inform other decision criteria in the evidence-to-decision framework, including people’s values, resources, acceptability, feasibility and equity, presented in Web Annex A. This review was enriched by primary studies identified by GDG members. This review focused on evidence informing HTN management in low- and middle- income settings. 4 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS 2.5 Certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations The GDG rated the certainty of evidence and developed the recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (4). When making recommendations, GRADE defines the certainty of a body of evidence as “the extent of our confidence that the estimates of an effect are adequate to support a particular decision or recommendation” (5). Members of the GDG, with the help of the methodologist, developed evidence profiles to summarize relative and absolute estimates of effects, and an assessment of the certainty of the evidence. One evidence profile for each comparison within a PICO question was constructed, using the online Guideline Development Tool GRADEpro (https://gradepro.org). When there were systematic reviews addressing the relative effects in specific subpopulations, separate evidence profiles were constructed for each subpopulation. According to the GRADE approach, the certainty of the evidence can be high, moderate, low, or very low.

The strength of the recommendations reflects the degree of confidence of the GDG that the desirable effects (e.g. beneficial health outcomes) of the recommendations outweigh the undesirable effects (e.g. adverse effects). The strength of recommendations in this guideline was graded into two categories: A strong recommendation is one for which the GDG was confident that the desirable effects of adhering to the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects. A weak or conditional recommendation is one for which the GDG concluded that the desirable effects of adhering to the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, but was not confident about these trade-offs. ENILEDIUG EHT GNIPOLEVED ROF DOHTEM 5 2.6 Deciding upon recommendations The GDG met virtually for four sessions in February 2021. Systematic reviews and GRADE tables were presented at the meeting. Formulation of recommendations and their strength were facilitated by the chair and supported by the methodologist, with the aim of achieving unanimous consensus. While the plan was to use a simple majority vote, full consensus was reached on all recommendations. The GDG used evidence-to-decision tables to guide the process of developing recommendations. These tables addressed the certainty of evidence, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, values, resource use and cost-effectiveness, equity, acceptability and feasibility. These tables are available in Web Annex B, and the full evidence profiles in Web Annex A. The WHO Steering Group noted remarks made by members of the External Review Group and considered incorporating these into the final guideline. Some evidence-to-decision frameworks were consolidated to provide recommendations that are more practical and implementable from an end-user perspective; hence, the 11 questions led to eight recommendations. 2.7 Funding The development of this guideline was financially supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. 6 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS 3 Recommendations 3.1 Blood pressure threshold for initiation of pharmacological treatment 1.

RECOMMENDATION ON BLOOD PRESSURE THRESHOLD FOR INITIATION OF PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT WHO recommends initiation of pharmacological antihypertensive treatment of individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension and systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mmHg. Strong recommendation, moderate- to high-certainty evidence WHO recommends pharmacological antihypertensive treatment of individuals with existing cardiovascular disease and systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mmHg. Strong recommendation, moderate- to high-certainty evidence WHO suggests pharmacological antihypertensive treatment of individuals without cardiovascular disease but with high cardiovascular risk, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease, and systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mmHg. Conditional recommendation, moderate- to high-certainty evidence Implementation remarks: [ Initiation of pharmacological hypertension (HTN) treatment should start no later than four weeks following diagnosis of HTN. If blood pressure level is high (e.g. systolic ≥160 mmHg or diastolic ≥100 mmHg) or there is accompanying evidence of end organ damage, initiation of treatment should be started without delay. Evidence and rationale The GDG reviewed evidence from 14 relevant systematic reviews that summarized data from a large number of randomized trials involving over 120 000 adult participants (Web Annex A). Evidence summaries are presented for the general population and for higher-risk populations (with diabetes (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), prior stroke) and were presented for various systolic blood pressure (SBP) thresholds (Web Annex A). The anticipated benefits of a lower blood pressure (BP) target (140 SBP in the general population and 130 SBP in a high-risk population) were reduction in mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure events. The anticipated harms were mostly not serious side-effects, and some were a surrogate outcome, such as rise in creatinine that may not be clinically relevant. On average, treatment was associated with a reduction in deaths and cardiovascular events that ranged from 5 to 10/1000 and harms that ranged from 20 to 30/1000. The benefits were a reduction in severe events with significant morbidity and mortality whereas the harms were mostly not clinically significant. In summary, the anticipated benefits were large and clearly outweighed the harms. The overall certainty varied from moderate to high, depending on the BP level and agent used.

SNOITADNEMMOCER 7 Evidence-to-decision considerations The value of antihypertensive therapy is well accepted by most patients, health care providers, health systems, professional societies and government agencies. From a patient’s perspective, preventing cardiovascular events is highly valued. However, some individuals who are eligible for antihypertensive treatment may not present to care, may be lost to follow up, or are prescribed a treatment but fail to take/adhere to the treatment. Treatment may be perceived as low value from the perspective of an asymptomatic patient unless the person is convinced of a trade-off between immediate inconvenience/ side-effects and potential long-term health gains (6). The patient perception of an unfavourable cost- benefit may be further exacerbated by the requirement for out-of-pocket payment for appointments or medications. Therefore, the GDG considered that although there is important variability in stakeholder values, overall initiation of hypertension (HTN) medications is likely to be feasible and acceptable overall. Given that the barriers to accessing HTN care in low-income settings include low patient health literacy, lack of financial protections, and limited resources (7), the GDG felt that health inequalities would probably be reduced by HTN treatment. In terms of costs and resource requirements, the GDG acknowledged variability, based on the structure of a country’s public health system and its economic status. Other costs, including human resources and medications, were considered moderate, given the benefits. Multiple sources of cost effectiveness are available from various countries, such as Argentina, Nigeria, the USA and UK (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), and for lower thresholds and higher-risk individuals (14, 15, 16). Most cost-effectiveness estimates were clustered below USD 1000 per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY) – well below the average 2017 GDP per capita for lower-middle income countries of USD 2188 (17), suggesting that pharmacological treatment could be very cost-effective for this group of countries. HTN treatment (treating all with BP ≥140/90 mmHg) has been shown to be cost-effective and a “best buy” intervention by the Kostova study (8). Treating high-risk/CVD patients with baseline 130–139 mmHg has been shown to be cost effective, but not cost saving (SPRINT cost-effective analyses) (15); value depends on maintaining the intervention effect for more than five years. 3.2 Laboratory testing before and during pharmacological treatment 2. RECOMMENDATION ON LABORATORY TESTING When starting pharmacological therapy for hypertension, WHO suggests obtaining tests to screen for comorbidities and secondary hypertension, but only when testing does not delay or impede starting treatment. Conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence Implementation remarks: [ Suggested tests include serum electrolytes and creatinine, lipid panel, HbA1C or fasting glucose, urine dipstick, and electrocardiogram (ECG). [ In low-resourced areas or non-clinical settings, where testing may not be possible because of additional costs, and lack of access to laboratories and ECG, treatment should not be delayed, and testing can be done subsequently.

Therefore, indirect evidence was sought to evaluate this question. An analytic framework was developed to conceptualize the rationale for obtaining diagnostic testing, such as laboratory tests and electrocardiogram (ECG), in this context (see Fig. 2). This framework identified the four most important reasons for obtaining testing, which are to diagnose secondary HTN, identify comorbidities (e.g. DM), identify end organ damage (e.g. chronic kidney disease (CKD) or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)), and for cardiac risk stratification. Fig. 2 Framework for analysis PICO 2: No comparative studies Desirable effects of testing Follow-up tests Identification of: (cid:127) secondary HTN (cid:127) comorbidities (e.g. DM) (cid:127) end organ damage (e.g. People with Laboratory tests CKD, LVH) Treatment Patient-important high BP ECG outcomes Opportunity to: (cid:127) develop cardiac risk stratification (cid:127) choose certain medications over others Undesirable effects of Color legend: testing (cid:127) incidental findings direct evidence (cid:127) cost (cid:127) delay in starting treatment indirect evidence In terms of secondary HTN, various studies suggest a prevalence of 5–10% among patients with a diagnosis of HTN and a higher prevalence of 10–30% among patients with particularly high BP (e.g. over 175/115 mmHg) or BP that is resistant to treatment (18, 19, 20). Morbidities and end organ damage that could be identified by testing patients with HTN are also common. One estimation indicates that 23%, 24% and 39% of patients with a diagnosis of HTN have one, two, three or more comorbidities respectively. Common comorbidities among patients with HTN that can be discovered via laboratory testing are hyperlipidaemia and diabetes, which have a prevalence of 56% and 27% respectively (21). Testing at the point of starting HTN medications or for subsequent monitoring can also identify patients who develop certain adverse events after treatment (e.g. hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury), thus providing a rationale for testing. Testing also had the additional advantage of identifying compelling indications for choosing certain medications over others. For example, identifying diabetes would favour the use of ACEis/ARBs, and identifying hyponatraemia would lead to not starting diuretics. Overall, the desirable effects of testing were judged to be at least moderate. The framework also identified the most undesirable effects of obtaining testing, which were delay of starting treatment, cost and incidental findings.

The framework also identified the most undesirable effects of obtaining testing, which were delay of starting treatment, cost and incidental findings. Delay of treatment was judged to be the most important concern since it can lead to losing the patient for follow up and the potential for adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Incidental findings on testing were thought to be less important. The undesirable effects of testing were judged to have smaller magnitude. On balance, desirable effects are likely to outweigh undesirable effects. The certainty of evidence across outcome was judged to be very low due to serious concerns about the indirectness of evidence. SNOITADNEMMOCER 9 Evidence-to-decision considerations There is uncertainty about patients’ values and preferences regarding the issue of testing before starting treatment for HTN. The cost of tests such as electrolytes, creatinine, lipid panel, glucose, HbA1C, urine dipstick, and ECG relative to overall costs of treatment and complications of HTN are small (22). However, in less well-resourced settings, this cost can have a large impact. Furthermore, if additional tests like ECG or 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring were added, the cost can become a barrier (23). It is unknown whether testing would lead to cost saving or be cost-effective. Testing was judged to be acceptable to most stakeholders, particularly patients and health care providers, and to a lesser extent to those governing health systems. Requiring testing before starting HTN medications can exacerbate health inequities and may not be feasible in low-resource settings. 3.3 Cardiovascular disease risk assessment as guide to initiation of antihypertensive medications 3. RECOMMENDATION ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK ASSESSMENT WHO suggests cardiovascular risk assessment at or after the initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension, but only where this is feasible and does not delay treatment. Conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence Implementation remarks: [ Most patients with SBP ≥140 or DBP ≥90 mmHg are high risk and indicated for pharmacological treatment; they do not require cardiovascular (CVD) risk assessment prior to initiating treatment. CVD risk assessment is most important for guiding decisions about initiating pharmacological treatment for hypertension (HTN) in those with lower SBP (130–139 mmHg). It is critical in those with HTN that other risk factors must be identified and treated appropriately to lower total cardiovascular risk. [ Many CVD risk-assessment systems are available. In the absence of a calibrated equation for the local population, the choice should depend on resources available, acceptability and feasibility of application. [ Whenever risk assessment may threaten timely initiation of HTN treatment and/or patient follow up, it should be postponed and included in the follow-up strategy, rather than taken as a first step to indicate treatment. Evidence and rationale The most direct evidence is derived from an individual patient data meta-analysis by Karmali that compared the number of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at five", "page_start": 21, "page_end": 22, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789240033986-eng.pdf"}

[ Whenever risk assessment may threaten timely initiation of HTN treatment and/or patient follow up, it should be postponed and included in the follow-up strategy, rather than taken as a first step to indicate treatment. Evidence and rationale The most direct evidence is derived from an individual patient data meta-analysis by Karmali that compared the number of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at five years when using a CVD risk assessment strategy (based on age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, previous antihypertensive treatment, smoking, diabetes mellitus (DM), and history of CVD) vs BP levels alone for determining which patients receive treatment (24). This analysis suggested that risk assessment can potentially prevent 310 MACE events in 1000 people over five years, which the GDG considered to be a moderate- to-large benefit. However, this evidence was indirect for many reasons, including the effect being dependent on the BP at presentation (graphs diverge at higher level of BP, compared with starting medications without risk assessment) and the fact that these trials did not actually randomize patients to the two strategies sought in PICO question 3 (see Annex 4). Furthermore this evidence should not suggest that people with intermediate risk would not have important treatment benefit. There was no evidence of the undesirable anticipated effects of starting treatment based on cardiovascular risk assessment. However, delay in initiating care for HTN management and loss to follow up are important considerations, especially in low-resource settings. 10 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS The GDG deduced that benefits of risk assessment may not all be attributable to risk assessment per se, but rather to the various treatments provided for risk factors identified during risk assessment. The certainty of evidence across outcome was judged to be very low due to serious concerns about the indirectness of evidence. Overall, the desirable effects of risk assessment at or after initiating HTN medications outweighed the plausible undesirable effects, particularly when risk assessment was deemed not to delay the initiation of treatment. Evidence-to-decision considerations There is important uncertainty over the value stakeholders place on conducting a CVD risk assessment prior to starting pharmacological treatment, and it was noted that patient perspectives may vary, depending on the setting. In low-resource settings, patients may focus more on immediate treatment without having to bear additional costs for screening for other risk factors and treating them. Studies have also shown that in high-income countries (HICs) such as the United States, people of a lower socioeconomic status have lower control of blood pressure and higher CVD risk over the years (25). Thus, in low-resource settings, adding one more step before initiating treatment may increase inequities, as those patients who have limited access to health care services may suffer delays in treatment or even end up not receiving HTN treatment at all. In terms of costs, there is no direct evidence of whether treatment of HTN with or", "page_start": 22, "page_end": 23, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789240033986-eng.pdf"}

Thus, in low-resource settings, adding one more step before initiating treatment may increase inequities, as those patients who have limited access to health care services may suffer delays in treatment or even end up not receiving HTN treatment at all. In terms of costs, there is no direct evidence of whether treatment of HTN with or without risk stratification is more cost effective. The cost of implementation of CVD risk assessment should also account for capacity building of health care providers and the time taken to do so for each patient. Cost of testing and delay in initiating care can be significant following a CVD risk stratification strategy in low-resource settings. Modelling by Gaziano et al. showed significant cost reduction using CVD risk- stratification before initiation of treatment in low-resource settings. However, screening costs, including the cost of obtaining risk-factor information, productivity costs due to work loss, care costs and travel time were not included in the analysis (26). A meta-analysis showed that proportional relative risk reduction in major CVD events from BP lowering did not differ substantially with the presence or absence of previous CVD events, coronary heart disease, or cerebrovascular disease. Hence, the absolute benefit of blood pressure lowering would be greatest in those with the highest absolute risk of CVD (27). 3.4 Drug classes to be used as first-line agents To develop a recommendation that is practical and implementable by end-users, the evidence-to-decision frameworks of PICO questions 4 and 5 (see Annex 4) were used to develop one recommendation. 4. RECOMMENDATION ON DRUG CLASSES TO BE USED AS FIRST-LINE AGENTS For adults with hypertension requiring pharmacological treatment, WHO recommends the use of drugs from any of the following three classes of pharmacological antihypertensive medications as an initial treatment: 1. thiazide and thiazide-like agents 2. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) 3. long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence Implementation remarks: [ Long-acting antihypertensives are preferred. [ Examples of indications to consider specific agents include diuretics or CCBs in patients over 65 years or those of African descent, beta-blockers in ischaemic heart disease, ACEis/ARBs in patients with severe proteinuria, diabetes mellitus, heart failure or kidney disease. SNOITADNEMMOCER 11 Evidence and rationale Data from 32 systematic reviews were used to derive evidence on benefits and harms of various medication classes (19 for comparisons against placebo and 13 for head-to-head comparisons). These reviews summarized the results of a many large randomized trials (Web Annex A). The anticipated benefits were considered to be large. Mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) reduction per 1000 treated people for the various classes were 3 and 14 (low-dose thiazide), 12 and 39 (high-dose thiazide), 23 and 48 (ACEi), 8 and 23 (CCB), 2 and 8 (beta-blockers) and 14 and no data for MACE (ARBs) respectively. The anticipated adverse events were judged to be moderate. Compared to placebo,", "page_start": 23, "page_end": 24, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789240033986-eng.pdf"}

The anticipated adverse events were judged to be moderate. Compared to placebo, 60 and 100 additional adverse events per 1000 treated people were observed for thiazides and beta- blockers respectively. Withdrawal from ACEi treatment and cough per 1000 treated people were 12 and 26 respectively. A systematic review of studies of pharmacotherapy for HTN in sub-Saharan Africa showed a rate of side-effects of CCB of 6% (headache), 2% (dizziness) 2% (ankle oedema) (28). In terms of the head-to-head comparisons among various classes, there was a smaller body of evidence, with less data available on hard endpoints and patient-important outcomes. Comparisons showed overall minimal differences in SBP or DBP. For example, ACEis/ARBs vs CCBs differed by less than 2 mmHg, and so did comparisons between ACEis/ARBs vs thiazide or ACEis vs ARB. There were more stroke events with beta-blockers than CCBs or ACEis/ARBs. The anticipated benefits clearly outweighed the potential harms for three classes of medications: thiazide and thiazide-like agents, ACEis/ARBs, and long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs. The adverse events of these three classes were infrequent, usually mild, and can be managed or another agent can be substituted. The amount of BP reduction appeared to be a more major determinant of reduction in CV events than the choice between these three classes of antihypertensive medications, as was shown in several landmark trials (ALLHAT, VALUE, CAMELOT trials) (29, 30, 31). This balance of benefits and harms was not as clear for beta-blockers as a first choice for HTN management. In terms of potential subgroups of patients that may benefit more from specific medication classes, ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) suggested greater BP reduction in individuals of African descent with chlorthalidone than lisinopril, and that stroke was significantly less likely with the diuretic than with the lisinopril in this group of patients than in those of Caucasian ethnicity (32). Other studies suggested benefit of diuretics or CCBs in patients over 65 years of age or of African descent, beta-blockers in patients with HTN who are post-myocardial infarction, ACEis/ ARBs in diabetes mellitus, heart failure or kidney disease (33, 34). Diuretics were likely to be the most efficacious medications, and CCBs the least efficacious medications for the prevention of heart failure. The overall certainty of evidence varied from high to moderate for these three classes of medications when compared against placebo. It was noted that diuretic trials were older and practice patterns may have changed over time, and that the severity and stage spectrum of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease varied in the available trials.

It was noted that diuretic trials were older and practice patterns may have changed over time, and that the severity and stage spectrum of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease varied in the available trials. In addition, evidence supporting the efficacy of antihypertensive drug therapy is derived from trials conducted in adults at high risk for CVD/atherosclerotic CVD. Since CVD risk increases with higher levels of BP, and given that risk factors for CVD tend to track together, the assumption of greater benefits using CVD risk could be attributed to this. 12 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS Evidence-to-decision considerations The value of antihypertensive therapy is well accepted by most patients, health care providers, health systems, professional societies and government agencies. From a patient’s perspective, preventing cardiovascular events is highly valued. However, some individuals who are eligible for antihypertensive treatment may evade efforts aimed at treatment or are prescribed a treatment but fail to take/adhere to the treatment. The asymptomatic nature of the disease and concern about adverse events are the likely driver for this perspective. Interviews of patients in England suggested greater acceptance of antihypertensive drug therapy with higher socioeconomic status. In one study, as many as 35% of the Caucasians and 20% of the South Asians in the two lowest socioeconomic categories told their interviewer that they would not accept antihypertensive drug therapy (35). Shahaj et al. (6) synthesized six qualitative and 29 quantitative reviews and identified a range of individual and social factors that affect treatment adherence, including familial (lack of support, need for separate meals), and environmental (sense of security, local amenities, healthy food availability). A review by Fragasso et al. (36) suggested that quality of life on antihypertensive therapy is an important issue because clinicians are asked to initiate drug therapy in mostly asymptomatic patients who are never happy to become, instead, symptomatic because of side-effects. Therefore, the GDG considered that there is important variability in stakeholder values, but overall initiation of HTN medications is likely to be feasible and acceptable overall. Considering the ample literature on disparities in adherence to BP medication regimes and cardiovascular outcomes based on race or socioeconomic status, treatment was judged to reduce health inequities. In terms of costs and resource requirements, thiazide-like agents, ACEis/ARBs and long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs are available as generic drugs, are simple to manufacture, and should be available at low cost globally. Other costs related to workforce requirements, provision of infrastructure, laboratory testing, lost work time etc. are real but modest. Numerous modelling studies demonstrate cost effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy, which is especially beneficial in LMICs where large numbers of adults have untreated HTN, as long as medications are available at low cost. Models were available from many countries, including Bangladesh, Ghana and Nigeria (37,", "page_start": 24, "page_end": 25, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789240033986-eng.pdf"}

Models were available from many countries, including Bangladesh, Ghana and Nigeria (37, 38, 39, 40). 3.5 Combination therapy To develop a recommendation that is practical and implementable by end-users, the evidence- to-decision frameworks of PICO questions 6, 7 and 8 (see Annex 4) were used to develop one recommendation. 5. RECOMMENDATION ON COMBINATION THERAPY For adults with hypertension requiring pharmacological treatment, WHO suggests combination therapy, preferably with a single-pill combination (to improve adherence and persistence), as an initial treatment. Antihypertensive medications used in combination therapy should be chosen from the following three drug classes: diuretics (thiazide or thiazide-like), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Conditional recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence Implementation remarks: [ Combination medication therapy may be especially valuable when the baseline BP is ≥20/10 mmHg higher than the target blood pressure. [ Single-pill combination therapy improves medication-taking adherence and persistence and BP control. SNOITADNEMMOCER 13 Evidence and rationale The GDG developed three PICO questions to address: monotherapy vs combination therapy as a first- line treatment for HTN, a comparison of the various combination therapies, and a comparison of single- pill combinations vs multiple-pill combinations. These three questions were addressed separately in the evidence profiles and evidence-to-decision framework, but eventually led to one recommendation. The evidence base consisted of six, seven and eight systematic reviews respectively (Web Annex A). Evidence summaries demonstrate several comparisons of combination therapy to monotherapy. Data on mortality, MACE and other hard endpoints were imprecise. Combination therapy lowered SBP more than monotherapy did (e.g. standard dose CCB combined with ARB vs high dose CCB; or ACEi and ARB combination vs either drug class alone) and had fewer adverse events (standard dose CCB combined with ARB vs high dose CCB). Data on cardiovascular outcomes are limited from randomized trials. A large nonrandomized study from Italy (125 635 patients, age 40–85 years) evaluated those who started antihypertensive treatment with one drug vs a two-drug single-pill or free combination. Propensity score adjusted analysis suggests that an initial two-drug single-pill or free combination was associated with significant reductions in the risk of death (20%, 11–28%) and hospitalization for cardiovascular events (16%, 10–21%) compared with initial monotherapy (41).

Other desirable effects of a combination therapy are improved treatment adherence and persistence. However, many of these studies used a single-pill combination, thereby confounding the question of monotherapy vs combination therapy. A meta-analysis compared adherence and persistence between groups of patients taking antihypertensives as single-pill combinations vs free-equivalent components based on 12 retrospective database studies. Adherence, measured as the mean difference in medication possession ratio, was 8–14% higher with a single-pill combination. Persistence was also twice as likely (42). A second systematic review demonstrated that simplifying dosing regimens results in significant improvements in medication adherence, ranging from 6% to 20% (43). The desirable effects of greater adherence/persistence, improved BP control, and potentially improved clinical outcomes of combinations of the three classes of antihypertensive therapy compared outweigh the undesirable effects such as side-effects, particularly when provided as a single-pill combination. The overall certainty in evidence was low across the outcomes of interest, noting that evidence was limited in terms of hard endpoints. Evidence-to-decision considerations In terms of stakeholder values and preferences about monotherapy vs combination therapy or the various combination therapies, data were minimal. No important variability in values was expected with regard to the critical outcomes. A systematic review demonstrated that simplifying dosing regimens results in significant improvements in medication adherence, ranging from 6% to 20% (43). Considering the comparative ease of using a single-pill combination over multiple-pill combinations, and the anticipated impact on adherence and persistence, the GDG judged that from a patient perspective the single-pill option will be favoured by most. Combination therapy is accompanied initially by a moderate increase in resource requirements, such as procurement, supply chain, and direct medication costs. Some combinations may be expensive, or not allow for exact dosing of both agents. However, the net benefit of improved BP control and reduction of major events associated with the hypertensive process compared to the increase in cost is large. BP control is also likely to be achieved sooner with combination therapy. Many modelling studies that evaluated combination vs monotherapy used a fixed dose (thereby not truly addressing the question). One model from Japan used data from randomized trials and compared low-dose combination therapy of controlled-release nifedipine (20 mg/day) plus candesartan (8 mg/day) vs titrated monotherapy of 14 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS candesartan.

However, disease-related inpatient services utilization costs were lower compared with the up-titration strategy, which may offset initial costs (45). In one model from China, olmesartan/amlodipine as a single pill was dominant, compared with olmesartan and amlodipine free combination and valsartan/amlodipine single-pill combination (46). In a second study, there was a reduction in the cost of therapy of 33%, with a saving of USD 19 per patient/month after switching from free combination to the single-pill combination (47). Since single-pill combination therapy increases medication adherence and persistence, which could improve HTN control rates and decrease major clinical events, the impact on health equities is expected to be favourable. In terms of acceptability, combination therapy, including in a single-pill form, can initially be met with scepticism among stakeholders, including health care providers. However, this initial scepticism may improve once BP control improves. Despite effective, safe, affordable, and available pharmacological antihypertensive agents, the control rates of HTN are dismal worldwide, and over the last 5 to 10 years have been decreasing in some HICs, and in LMICS, in tandem with increasing major cardiovascular events. Over 30% of the world population has HTN and only 13.8% of cases are considered controlled (48). One major reason for this poor level of control (one in seven) is that most patients only receive monotherapy, whereas empirical evidence demonstrates that most patients require two drugs or more to achieve optimal and sustained control (44, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52). The rationale for recommending a combination therapy, particularly in a single-pill approach, is based on the following considerations: [ most individuals with HTN will eventually require two or more antihypertensive agents to achieve BP control; [ the combination of two agents from complementary classes yields greater BP-reduction efficacy (at least equal to the sum of the efficacy of each chosen agent); [ lower doses of each agent are needed, which results in a reduction of side-effects and the fact that use of complementary classes of antihypertensive agents may mitigate the side-effects of each agent; [ adherence and persistence are increased; and [ simplified logistics can lead to fewer stock-outs and a reduced pharmacy inventory (53, 54). In terms of feasibility, a study from India compared prices of antihypertensive single-pill combinations and equivalent single-agent pills in the private health care sector. The results suggested that manufacturers have priced the combination higher than the price of its components. These data demonstrate that the price of combination pills could be lowered to match the combined price of the component, and that manufacturing costs and market forces do not present a barrier to the implementation of antihypertensive combination pills (55).", "page_start": 27, "page_end": 27, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789240033986-eng.pdf"}

Thus, the intervention is likely feasible to implement. The GDG acknowledged some challenges to single-pill combinations, such as limited flexibility in modifying the doses of individual components, and difficulty in attributing side-effects to one of its components (56). Although randomized trials addressing this issue are not abundant, and those available are not sufficiently large or conducted for a long enough period to clearly address differences in major clinical events, the initial combination treatment approach has been in place for over 15 years in large health systems, such as the Kaiser Permanente system in the United States (57) and is a major component of the WHO Global HEARTS Programme and the PAHO HEARTS in the Americas Initiative (53). Recently, combination antihypertensive medications in a single pill have been added to the WHO Essential Medicines List (49). This approach has demonstrated general acceptance by government, public, and private stakeholders and is demonstrating success in increasing HTN control rates worldwide. SNOITADNEMMOCER 15 3.6 Target blood pressure 6. RECOMMENDATION ON TARGET BLOOD PRESSURES WHO recommends a target blood pressure treatment goal of <140/90 mmHg in all patients with hypertension without comorbidities. Strong recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence WHO recommends a target systolic blood pressure treatment goal of <130 mmHg in patients with hypertension and known cardiovascular disease (CVD). Strong recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence WHO suggests a target systolic blood pressure treatment goal of <130 mmHg in high-risk patients with hypertension (those with high CVD risk, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease). Conditional recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence Evidence and rationale The evidence base consisted of five systematic reviews as well as a review of the SPRINT trial (58). Evidence profiles were constructed for various BP treatment targets, based on age and comorbidities (Web Annex A). The desirable effects of lower target BP (per 1000 treated patients) were: a reduction in mortality of 27 (for SBP <120 vs <130–139) and of 7 (for SBP 140/90 vs 150–160/95–105); a reduction in cardiovascular mortality of 40 (for SBP <130 vs <130–149) and 6 (for SBP 140/90 vs 150–160/95–105); and a reduction in stroke of 17 (for SBP <130 vs <140). The increase in serious adverse events per 1000 treated patients was 20 (for SBP <130 vs <140) and 5 (for SBP 140/90 vs 150–160/95–105). Summary results from a systematic review focusing on adults 65 years and older by Murad et al (59). suggests that treatment to a lower BP target in individuals 65 years or older leads to a significant reduction in all-cause and CVD mortality, chronic kidney disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke", "page_start": 27, "page_end": 28, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789240033986-eng.pdf"}

The increase in serious adverse events per 1000 treated patients was 20 (for SBP <130 vs <140) and 5 (for SBP 140/90 vs 150–160/95–105). Summary results from a systematic review focusing on adults 65 years and older by Murad et al (59). suggests that treatment to a lower BP target in individuals 65 years or older leads to a significant reduction in all-cause and CVD mortality, chronic kidney disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke outcomes. Similar conclusions were provided by another systematic review by Reboussin et al (60). Neither of these meta-analyses was able to account for the high risk of patients enrolled in the available trials – at least in SPRINT and ACCORD (11, 61). Therefore, the GDG cautions against applying this evidence to lower-risk patients with raised BP or HTN – specifically, those not meeting trial eligibility criteria for SPRINT, ACCORD or SPS3 (62). Network meta-analyses found a similar direction of effect but more optimistic beneficial effect sizes with intensive treatment (63, 64). In patients with comorbidity (CAD, DM, CKD) there is consistent benefit with lower targets (variable thresholds); however, data in these subgroups were imprecise and the evidence was less certain. Adverse events such as dizziness in intensive control group and ischaemia in patients with coronary artery disease can shift the balance of benefits and harms in those aged 65 years or older. Concern about lower adherence due to the need for extra patient and provider effort to reach lower targets should also be balanced against intensive control. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be moderate, with large benefits and moderate harms. The GDG made a judgement that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects at a treatment goal of <140/90 mmHg in all patients with HTN without comorbidities and of <130 mmHg in high-risk patients with HTN – those with high CVD risk, diabetes, chronic kidney disease. 16 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS Evidence-to-decision considerations From a patient perspective, HTN is often a silent disease and patients may not take antihypertensive medications as directed because the positive effects of these medications are not as obvious as potential side-effects (61). Society and patients want to avoid premature mortality or disability. Serious adverse events are also feared, but their duration and severity are often not well characterized in trials. Lower targets are likely acceptable to other stakeholders, such as governments and providers, though there are usually several competing priorities and interests – especially the more acute demands of, and a higher priority placed on, acute conditions and health emergencies. Many well-known barriers to access to HTN care in low-income settings exist (6). Investment in the primary health care platform required for effective HTN management is often a challenge. Countries with low rates of HTN control using more conservative BP thresholds may feel burdened by any request to set more ambitious BP treatment goals, even if only in selected high-risk patients.

Countries with low rates of HTN control using more conservative BP thresholds may feel burdened by any request to set more ambitious BP treatment goals, even if only in selected high-risk patients. Intensive treatment for selected patients adds complexity for health workers; emphasis on team-based care in low-resource settings means that simple, protocolized care is needed. Intensive treatment for some patients complicates treatment protocols and may lead to decisional overload, especially for health workers with more limited training and/or autonomy. On the other hand, strict BP targets in the general population with HTN are likely to be less acceptable to stakeholders. Most available evidence is derived from high-risk patients receiving intensive treatment and not the general population living with HTN. Treating HTN will reduce health inequity because preventing CV events reduces mortality across the population. Uncontrolled HTN might be over- represented in vulnerable populations. Therefore, improvement of HTN treatment and control through better treatment and a lower BP target could reduce long-standing inequality. Regarding costs, intensive treatment in the SPRINT trial meant one additional medication, one additional office visit, and one additional laboratory test evaluation on average, and additional titration visits per participant over 3.25 years, compared with standard treatment. In the United States, this translates to about USD 23 000 more per patient per year over their remaining lifetime (14, 15). Health care costs are much less in countries other than the United States. Treating to lower BP targets will have diminishing returns in progressively lower-risk patients as the magnitude of benefit becomes smaller. A cost-effectiveness study of screening and optimal management of HTN, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease in an Australian setting found that an intensive management of previously uncontrolled HTN compared with usual care resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AUD 2588. The study does not specify the target BP for the comparisons (65). A SPRINT trial health economic analysis provided similar inferences (48, 50). 3.7 Frequency of re-assessment 7. RECOMMENDATION ON FREQUENCY OF ASSESSMENT WHO suggests a monthly follow up after initiation or a change in antihypertensive medications until patients reach target. Conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence WHO suggests a follow up every 3–6 months for patients whose blood pressure is under control. Conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence SNOITADNEMMOCER 17 There was a minimal number of comparative studies that evaluated different follow-up lengths after initiation of HTN medications.

Mean BP, control of HTN, patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment were similar between the two groups (66). A retrospective population-based cohort study of family-practice clinics in the UK (67) studied 88 756 adults with HTN (1986–2010). This study showed that in patients newly diagnosed with HTN, those with >1.4 months prior to initiation of treatment had a hazard ratio of 1.12 (1.05–1.20) for a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) compared to those who started treatment at <1.4 months. For patients who were initiated on treatment, those who waited >2.7 months before re-evaluation had a hazard ratio of 1.18 (1.11–1.25) for MACE compared to those reassessed at <2.7 months. In addition, when reviewing protocols of large HTN trials that demonstrated important improvement in cardiovascular events with BP control, such as ACCORD and SPRINT, the initial length of time to follow up was one month (68, 69). This evidence indirectly suggests the appropriateness of this initial follow up in settings that conferred important benefit. The anticipated desirable consequences of shorter follow up are better BP control and monitoring of side-effects, and perhaps improved adherence. Longer follow-up times are expected to lead to loss to follow up. A systematic review of the impact of interventions to improve medication adherence in adults prescribed antihypertensive medications suggested a decrease in adherence with an increase in time between intervention and follow up (70). The undesirable consequences of shorter follow up are the burden on patients and the health system. Certainty relating to these effects is very low. The GDG found no evidence related to the question of the optimal follow-up time after the point that the treated HTN patient achieves stable blood pressure control. Evidence-to-decision considerations Data on what patients consider significant in terms of the length of follow up after initiation of HTN medications are lacking. Many patients, particularly those aged 65 years or older, or who live alone, are likely to be reassured by more frequent monitoring of BP, which can identify early signs of clinical deterioration and provide a sense of security (71). However, younger asymptomatic patients may have the opposite perspective and find that frequent monitoring interferes with work and family responsibilities. Telemonitoring may reduce the need for follow up, especially for patients living in areas remote from health care facilities. However, despite existing evidence on the effectiveness of telemonitoring for patients with HTN, there is no empirical evidence of its long-term outcomes or generalizability to patients with various backgrounds and educational levels (72). Data on costs, resources and cost-effectiveness were unavailable. Frequent follow up is anticipated to be associated with additional resource requirements, which may be offset by improved adherence, BP control", "page_start": 30, "page_end": 30, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789240033986-eng.pdf"}

Data on costs, resources and cost-effectiveness were unavailable. Frequent follow up is anticipated to be associated with additional resource requirements, which may be offset by improved adherence, BP control and improved outcomes that are important to patients. Burden on the health system may be reduced by involving nonphysician providers in follow up. The WHO GDG considered a one-month follow up after initiation of medications for HTN to be a reasonable approach, whereas intervals of 3 to 6 months can be applied when patients’ BP is close to the target and stable. Due to the lack of comparative data, these recommended intervals should be viewed as suggestions and may be modified, based on feasibility and other contextual factors. Such intervals were judged to be feasible and acceptable to key stakeholders. The impact of such follow-up lengths on health equity is unclear. 18 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS 3.8 Administration of treatment by nonphysician professionals 8. RECOMMENDATION ON TREATMENT BY NONPHYSICIAN PROFESSIONALS WHO suggests that pharmacological treatment of hypertension can be provided by nonphysician professionals such as pharmacists and nurses, as long as the following conditions are met: proper training, prescribing authority, specific management protocols and physician oversight. Conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence Implementation remarks: [ Community health care workers (HCWs) may assist in tasks such as education, delivery of medications, blood pressure (BP) measurement and monitoring through an established collaborative care model. The scope of hypertension care practised by community HCWs depends on local regulations and currently varies by country. [ Telemonitoring and community or home-based self-care are encouraged to enhance the control of BP as a part of an integrated management system, when deemed appropriate by the treating medical team and found feasible and affordable by patients. [ Physician oversight can be done through innovative methods such as telemonitoring or similar to ensure access to treatment is not delayed. Evidence and rationale PICO question 11 (see Annex 4) addressed BP management by nonphysician health care workers (HCWs) as well as self-management by patients. The evidence base for this question consisted of 11 systematic reviews (Web Annex A). The available evidence focused on evaluating care models in which BP control was managed by pharmacists, nurses, dietitians, and community HCWs. The outcome assessed in these studies were BP level and control. There was no data on cardiovascular events. Although the certainty of evidence was in general low, the magnitude of effect showed better control in 91–264 more patients per 1000 (pharmacist studies) and an SBP/DBP reduction of 1–8 mmHg (nurse/ HCW/dietitian studies). No study showed that nonphysician management was inferior to physician management.

No study showed that nonphysician management was inferior to physician management. A systematic review by Greer et al., showed that pharmacist-managed care led to better BP control (relative risk 1.44 or 170 more controlled per 1000) with no obviously reported difference in adherence, clinical events or quality of life (73). A systematic review by Anand has shown that in LICs and MICs, task sharing with pharmacists led to reductions of 8 mmHg SBP and 3.74 mmHg DBP. Similar results were yielded by task sharing with nurses (5.34 mmHg lower), dieticians (4.67 mmHg lower), and community HCWs (3.67 mmHg lower) (74). Data on undesirable effects (harms) were unavailable, which may be due to publication bias, or reflect minimal harms. In terms of self-management, a systematic review by Tucker (75) shows that self-monitoring by patients led to a 3.24 mmHg lower level SBP and 1.5 DBP, both statistically significant, and better BP control, as long as self-monitoring was remotely managed by a HCW. However, the study limitation was the inability to adequately blind participants to the intervention. There was minimal evidence about self- titration on BP medications. The GDG also concluded that since the evidence was from HICs, it may be less applicable to other settings and that training of nonphysician HCWs varies considerably between countries. Overall the certainty of evidence was low, with large anticipated desirable effects and a small magnitude of undesirable effects. SNOITADNEMMOCER 19 Evidence-to-decision considerations There is significant variability in patient and provider perspectives. Overall, society and patients want to reduce the risk of premature mortality or morbidity. Most of the available quantitative data were focused on remote monitoring and not specifically on whether patients preferred BP being managed by physicians vs other providers, which was the primary question. Limited information provided mixed results, with some patients appreciating some applications of self-care while others were concerned that being managed by others could harm the patient–doctor relationship, but these comments were related to use of home-monitoring devices. In some studies in which BP was managed by nonphysicians, there was good patient satisfaction and high retention, suggesting at least willingness, if not a preference, to have BP managed by nonphysicians (76, 77).Conversely, in-depth interviews with a sample of patients in the UK explored nurse and pharmacist prescribing and demonstrated that patients had concerns about clinical governance, privacy and whether sufficient space was available to provide the service in community pharmacies. Participants had less concern about nursing management (78). Another study from Scotland explored patients’ perspectives on pharmacist prescribing and reported high patient satisfaction, but 65% stated that they would prefer to consult a doctor (79).

Another study from Scotland explored patients’ perspectives on pharmacist prescribing and reported high patient satisfaction, but 65% stated that they would prefer to consult a doctor (79). Presumably, health inequities are reduced, since task shifting in the public sector increases access to those using public health vs private health. Increasing access in underserved areas can improve inequities. Regarding costs, Jacob et al. (80) synthesized data from 31 studies (24 from the US) and suggested that studies that use community team approaches project a cost around USD 200/person/year to implement, but with cost-savings for prevention of CVD outcomes such that net costs had a median cost of USD 65/person/year, with 10 studies indicating negative or cost-savings overall. Most cost/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimates were between USD 3888 and USD 24 000/QALY, with pharmacist-led programmes being more cost-effective than nurse-led ones. Only two were >USD 50 000/QALY out of 28 studies. Most of the remaining cost data presented were related to self-monitoring and not to the question of physician-led vs nonphysician-led care. However, if it is assumed that nonphysician salaries are lower, then potentially costs will be lower, but that assumes that only limited effort by physicians is involved in any oversight of nonphysicians. Kulchaitanaroai et al. found similar results with a physician–pharmacist collaborative system (81). The two available analyses, by Jacob et al. and Kulchaitanaroai et al., focused on team-based interventions as opposed to specifically physician vs other provider, and it is not clear if incremental cost- effectiveness ratios fit countries in all economic categories, nor whether the countries’ willingness- to- pay thresholds were analysed. All values appear to be below USD 50 000/QALY. For the US, the results were highly cost-effective, with most estimates well under USD 50 000/QALY but it remains unclear exactly how these may be translated to countries in lower economic categories. Even at USD 10 000/ QALY, however, this would be acceptable for most MICs, though perhaps not for all LICs. However, if the costs were the same or lower in programmes led by nurses or pharmacists compared to those led by physicians then cost-saving was likely. The GDG proposed four conditions that must be met for nonphysician-prescribing of antihypertensives. These focused on the prescribers having proper training, prescribing authority in their locale, working within specific management protocols and having physician oversight. Community HCWs were suggested as personnel who could assist with tasks such as education, delivery of medications, BP measurement and monitoring through an established collaborative care model. Telemonitoring supervised by HCWs, and community- or home-based self-care, were considered as tools to enhance BP control as part of an integrated management system. 20 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS 4 Special settings 4.1 Hypertension in disaster, humanitarian and emergency settings", "page_start": 32, "page_end": 33, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789240033986-eng.pdf"}

This includes, but is not limited to, the wars in Syria and Iraq, the impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Hurricane Katrina, and the living conditions of Palestinian refugees. The burden of HTN on those populations can be considerable (82). There are very little data on HTN control, access to care and treatment, and patient understanding of HTN from Africa and Asia (except Japan), despite protracted refugee situations on these continents. Violent and protracted conflicts are disastrous to civilian populations and their health care systems, and result in interruptions to treatment and care (83, 84). Armed conflicts are associated with increased short-term and long-term cardiac morbidity and mortality and increases in blood pressure (BP) (85). Following exposure to conflict, research in military populations shows that post-traumatic stress disorder and severe injury are independent risk factors for the development of HTN (86). The rates of treatment ranged from 53.4% to 98.1% of patients with HTN in this population (87, 88). There are currently no data regarding target BP or the best antihypertensive agent to treat disaster- related HTN. Opinion-based recommendation is that the target BP control level should be less than 140 mmHg for SBP and less than 90 mmHg for DBP. According to Kario et al, long-acting CCBs are preferred because they are metabolically neutral, and best at reducing BP variability, which is an independent predictor of clinical outcomes, especially stroke. In addition, the BP-lowering effect of long-acting CCBs is dose-dependent, and the degree of BP reduction that can be anticipated from these agents is known (89). Despite the challenges of working in humanitarian settings, several agencies have produced guidelines for the identification and management of HTN. The WHO’s Interagency Emergency Health Kit has included a supplementary module with antihypertensive medications since 2017, but it is unclear how widely these are being used (90, 91). According to a personal communication from a physician who treated HTN in Syrian refugees, the treatment was variable, and dependent on whatever drug samples were available in the clinic. They had limited choices, including atenolol, lisinopril, and verapamil. Treatment was tailored to the patient’s history. For example, patients with a history of coronary artery disease received atenolol and lisinopril, patients with diabetes received lisinopril, and patients with migraine received verapamil.

Assessment of HTN and appropriate resourcing to treat it should be a priority for agencies providing emergency and longer-term care for patients after or during humanitarian crises to prevent significant mortality and morbidity. Further studies are needed to accurately estimate prevalence of HTN in crisis- affected populations throughout the world and to evaluate the best treatment approach for this population. Humanitarian crises and disaster settings (natural or humanmade) can affect health care and services in many different ways. A list of potential barriers that can affect the management of individuals with hypertension is as follows: [ significant decline of living standards [ loss/destruction of health care facilities [ flight of medical personnel causing shortage of medical care providers [ severe shortage of medicines [ lack or absence of essential supplies, equipment and materials [ compromise of the provision of primary and secondary health care [ interruption of water, food and electricity [ lack of morbidity and mortality data due to destruction of information systems and data collection [ high psychological stress burden on both general population and health care personnel. SGNITTES LAICEPS 21 4.2 COVID-19 and hypertension Almost all available evidence suggests that hypertension increases the risk of severe COVID-19, defined as admission to intensive care, clinically defined severity or a combination of these; or mortality. It was sometimes unclear, however, whether this risk was independent of other risk factors (92). Initial reports have identified higher rates of HTN among severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with overall HTN rates of 50–56% (93, 94). It had been unclear if this relationship was causal or confounded by age and other comorbidities associated with HTN, including obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Concerns regarding use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) in these patients were raised due to identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the monocarboxypeptidase that inactivates angiotensin II and thereby counters the activation of the classic renin–angiotensin– aldosterone system (RAAS), as the functional receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (95, 96). The WHO conducted a rapid review of evidence related to the use ACEis or ARBs in COVID patients which identified 11 observational studies. No studies were found that were designed to directly assess whether ACEis or ARBs increase the risk of acquiring COVID-19. After adjustment for confounders, history of ACEi or ARB use was not found to be associated with increased severity of COVID-19 illness. There were no studies that addressed the potential benefits and harms of initiating ACEis or ARBs as treatment for patients with COVID-19 (97). Accordingly, discontinuation of ACEis or ARBs may yield worse outcomes than continuation of their use in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19.

Accordingly, discontinuation of ACEis or ARBs may yield worse outcomes than continuation of their use in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. In contrast to the uncertainty about the potential benefit of initiating RAAS blocker use in patients with COVID-19, there is a clear potential for harm in withdrawing these agents in high-risk COVID-19 patients with established myocardial injury, HTN or heart failure (96). Most of the world’s professional societies either recommend or strongly encourage continuing ACEis/ARBs in COVID-19- infected patients (98). Further research that will address key unanswered questions about the role of the RAAS in the pathogenesis and possible treatment of COVID-19 and other coronavirus-based diseases is urgently needed. Prospective studies – in particular, ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials such as the Ramipril for the Treatment of COVID-19 (RAMIC) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04366050) may provide clearer insight regarding the effect of ACEis or ARBs in patients with COVID-19. 4.3 Pregnancy and hypertension Hypertension, including chronic HTN, gestational HTN, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia, is a very common medical condition in pregnancy (99). Due to the adverse consequences of increased morbidity and mortality to both the women and fetus, HTN in pregnancy must be diagnosed, treated (when appropriate), and followed up diligently. It is important to note that up to 10% of pregnancy-related deaths are attributed to HTN, and its presence in pregnancy leads to long-term adverse cardiovascular consequences. Unfortunately, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are markedly increasing (100, 101). For instance, in the United States between 1998 and 2006, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy increased from 6.7% to 8.3%, chronic HTN in pregnancy increased from 1.1% to 1.7%, and pre- eclampsia/eclampsia from 0.9% to 1.2%. The potential serious consequences of HTN and pregnancy and the contraindication in pregnancy of some of the commonly prescribed pharmacological antihypertensive medications discussed below should be discussed with women who are or could become pregnant. The normal haemodynamic state of pregnancy is one of systemic vasodilation accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and decrease in total peripheral resistance. This results in a normal decrease in BP in the second trimester. HTN in pregnancy is generally diagnosed when BP is ≥140 mmHg and/or ≥90 mmHg on at least two occasions, at least six hours apart. Chronic HTN is defined as a diagnosis of HTN before 20 weeks gestation, while gestational HTN is defined as a diagnosis of HTN at 20 weeks or later. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are pregnancy-specific medical conditions requiring immediate and specific medical management. 22 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS While BP treatment thresholds for HTN in pregnancy continue to change, it is generally recommended for both chronic and gestational HTN that pharmacologic treatment be initiated when the", "page_start": 34, "page_end": 35, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789240033986-eng.pdf"}

Chronic HTN is defined as a diagnosis of HTN before 20 weeks gestation, while gestational HTN is defined as a diagnosis of HTN at 20 weeks or later. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are pregnancy-specific medical conditions requiring immediate and specific medical management. 22 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS While BP treatment thresholds for HTN in pregnancy continue to change, it is generally recommended for both chronic and gestational HTN that pharmacologic treatment be initiated when the SBP is ≥160 mmHg and/or the DBP is ≥105 mmHg. In chronic HTN, frequently the woman has already been diagnosed with HTN prior to the pregnancy and thus may already be on chronic antihypertensive pharmacological therapy. In this case, the current regimen may be continued, with the caveat that the medication regimen may have to be changed to preferred medications, and certain antihypertensive medications that are contraindicated in pregnancy must be discontinued. The recommended treatment BP goal/target also has been subject to debate and is changing. For instance, achieving a lower BP target (DBP of 85 mmHg vs 100 mmHg) has recently been shown to decrease the maternal development of severe HTN while not increasing maternal or fetal risk. If target organ damage is present, initiating antihypertensive pharmacological treatment at a DBP of ≥90 mmHg should be considered. As with most, if not all, other medical conditions requiring pharmacological treatment during pregnancy, the treatment considerations in HTN are no different from those of non-pregnant adults. Thus, since medications are not studied specifically for efficacy and safety in pregnancy, medication selection is usually based on long-term clinical use and experience. This usually means older medications that have had a substantial long-term track record of efficacy and safety are to be considered. For the pharmacological treatment of HTN in pregnancy, preferred medications include methyldopa, beta-blockers (particularly labetalol), CCBs (particularly nifedipine and, as an alternative, verapamil), and the direct-acting vasodilators (particularly hydralazine). There is evidence to suggest that among these agents, beta-blockers and CCBs appear to be more effective than methyldopa in decreasing the development of severe HTN later in the pregnancy. The use of thiazide diuretics has been debated, particularly if the individual is already chronically on a thiazide prior to the pregnancy. In this situation the thiazide diuretic may be continued during the pregnancy. There are clear contraindications to the use of some antihypertensive medications during pregnancy. These include all the renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, such as the ACEis, the ARBs and, although not used any more, the direct-acting renin inhibitors, due to direct adverse effects on the fetus, and the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone due to fetal anti-androgen effects. The use of the beta-blocker atenolol is also contraindicated due to the observation of intrauterine fetal growth inhibition (102). In summary, HTN in pregnancy, manifested by the various hypertensive pregnancy disorders, is a very common medical condition. HTN pregnancy disorders have serious maternal and fetal consequences.

In addition, there are antihypertensive pharmacological agents that are contraindicated in pregnancy. There is evidence to support the pharmacological treatment of HTN in pregnancy at given BP thresholds without and with the presence of end organ damage to decrease the likelihood of the development of severe HTN later in the pregnancy. Even with the effective lowering of BP during the pregnancy and in the immediate post- partum period, the presence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy significantly increases long-term CV risk, including future HTN, coronary disease, and stroke. SGNITTES LAICEPS 23 5 Publication, implementation, evaluation and research gaps 5.1 Publication This guideline is available to download from the WHO website. Given that an overview of published systematic reviews was used for the development of the guideline, all reviews are already published and available online. 5.2 Implementation and dissemination WHO regional and country offices, through their contacts with ministries of health, will encourage implementation at country level. WHO will provide technical assistance if substantial country adaptation is required. The HEARTS technical package, which is currently being implemented in 18 countries and has significant partner endorsement, membership and engagement, will be the platform used to implement and disseminate this guideline. The package will be revised to include the implementation tools from this guideline. Separate implementation aspects are being considered as implementation or derivative tools for nonphysician treatment and the treatment of hypertension in areas of humanitarian crises, following publication of the guideline. Implementation support will be extended to countries through all three levels of WHO. 5.3 Evaluation WHO will monitor uptake and implementation of the guideline in national policies and programmes by reviewing the number of countries that have adapted or endorsed the guideline nationally. 5.4 Future updating of the guideline The guideline is expected to be valid for a period of five years. This period reflects the fact that new research findings are likely to become available in the meantime but also represents a feasible time frame, considering the costs, time and other resources that are needed for the updating process. If the evidence base or user needs change before the five-year mark, consideration will be given to producing updates sooner. 5.5 Research gaps Several research gaps were identified by the GDG according to the theme of the PICOs.

Managing declarations of interest and conflicts of interest The steering group followed the current Compliance, Risk Management and Ethics (CRE) policy. All members of the Guideline Development Group (GDG) were asked to fill in the standard WHO Declaration of Interest (DOI) forms, which were reviewed. The WHO Secretariat reviewed the curriculum vitae of each potential participant and conducted internet searches (PubMed, Open Payments Data, Google Scholar) for information on potential financial and academic conflicts of interest related to the subject of the meeting. All DOIs are on file at the WHO Department of Noncommunicable Diseases. The WHO Steering Group published the names and brief biographies of potential GDG members on the WHO website for more than two weeks, together with a description of the objective of the meeting, for public review and comment. There were no concerns raised about any members. None of the declared interests was judged sufficient to affect any of the experts’ objective judgement during the guidelines development process or on the recommendations, or therefore to preclude their full participation in the development of the guidelines. During the course of the development of the guideline, one GDG member’s status of conflict of interest changed as she accepted a temporary appointment as a staff member at WHO. She was removed from further GDG engagements immediately upon accepting appointment. All members of the GDG and all meeting observers were required to sign a confidentiality agreement before participating in the meeting. All members of the External Review Group (ERG) were asked to fill in the standard WHO DOI forms, which were reviewed. None of the declared interests was judged sufficient to affect any of the judgement during the review process, or therefore to preclude their participation as expert reviewers. 42 GUIDELINE FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN ADULTS Annex 3: Treatment outcomes relevant to hypertension Members of the WHO Steering Group, in consultation with the GDG and methodologist, developed a list of treatment outcomes most relevant to the care of individuals with hypertension. The GDG then rated each outcome on a scale from 1 to 9 and indicated whether it considered each outcome critical (rated 7–9), important (rated 4–6) or not important (rated 1–3) for decision-making (Fig. A3.1).

It is crucial to have ethical guidance as a baseline for judging public health surveillance for all diseases and exposure across national borders. The fragmented, disease-specifi c nature of international guidance is not surprising, given the uneven, incomplete state of public health surveillance in both high- and low-resource settings and different national and subnational mandates for surveillance in different legal sys- tems.

Background Defi ning public health surveillance Some countries defi ne surveillance narrowly, others quite broadly. These guidelines cover surveillance as broadly understood. In the simplest formulations, surveillance is defi ned as “continued watchfulness” (6) or “the mon- itoring of events in humans, linked to action” (7).

Examples of oversight mechanisms Public Health Ontario (Canada) In 2012, Public Health Ontario published “A framework for the conduct of public health initiatives”. It applies an integrated approach for ethics review, in which all evidence-generating initiatives undergo ethi- cal scrutiny proportionate to the level of risk. Its Ethics Review Board plays a vital role in helping to ensure that research and other initiatives conducted by Public Health Ontario are carried out in a manner that is consistent with the second edition of the Federal “Tri-council policy statement on ethical conduct for research involving humans and other relevant regulations, policies and guidelines”. The Ethics Review Board addresses research, evaluation, surveillance, and quality improvement projects that involve human partici- pants, their data, or their biological materials. Membership of the Board complies with the provisions of the Federal policy statement with regard to expert representation and composition, with members selected from Public Health Ontario and public health units and academic institutions in Ontario. They have expertise in various public health disciplines and in methodology, law, and ethics; the members also include community representatives. (Source: https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/About/Pages/Ethics-Review-Board.aspx) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Health Ethics Unit (USA) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established the Public Health Ethics Unit in the offi ce of the Associate Director for Science, which collaborates with the Public Health Ethics Committee. It provides support throughout the institution; its aims are to “integrate the tools of ethical analysis into day-to-day operations”.

Like those of the Ethics Review Board of Public Health Ontario and the Public Health Unit at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the mandate of the Public Health Ethics Consultation Service extends beyond surveillance. Programmes and initiatives are not required to be reviewed by this service: WHO staff solicit advice as needed in order to maximize fl exibility and ensure that ethical consultation is not viewed as a bureaucratic hurdle. Its advice is informal and non-binding. The group is made up of WHO staff, who receive continuing training in public health ethics and seek advice from the global network of WHO Collaborating Centres for Bioethics.

Box 2. Community engagement A particularly compelling, fl exible method for engaging communities is democratic deliberation. This is a structured method for decision-making that brings together diverse stakeholders to construct solutions to complex policy questions. Participants engage in discussion and dialogue, communicate their perspectives respectfully, and provide justifi cation for their views in a way that everyone involved can grasp. The goal is to make pressing decisions while considering empirical evidence, communities’ lived experience, and values. The US Bioethics Commission (64) has used the deliberative method as it has grappled with diffi cult issues fraught with tension and has made available a variety of training tools (65). While it is only one means of ensuring citizen involvement and is not appropriate for all situations, it has been a staple not only of local and national but also global decision-making. For example, in June 2016, (66) some 10 000 citizens in 76 countries expressed concern about climate change and recommended legally binding measures, including “reporting of [each nation’s] adaptation and mitigation efforts” to keep global warming below 2 °C.

Responsible authorities (see Guideline 8). should make special efforts to ensure that these populations are included in surveillance in ways that will empower them. How exactly situations of vulnerability should be defi ned is a subject of dispute in the literature (74). Vulnerability may be diffuse, affecting large communities with limited economic develop- ment, limited access to health care facilities, educational deprivation, occupational risks or wider disadvantages in society. Public health surveillance and health information systems can provide valuable information to aid the development of health programmes and ser- vices to address their health problems and the underlying determinants of health, such as clean water, food security, or gender equality. To promote equity, surveillance should focus on the specifi c problems of these vulnerable communities. People with particular susceptibility to disease, harm or injustice are also at increased risk for further burdens, such as discrimination and stigma, attributable to surveillance activities or fi ndings. For example, refugee groups and undocumented migrants with a higher disease burden may be seen, wrongly, as the cause of disease outbreaks.

Critically, names and other specifi c identifi ers are required for outbreak investigation or case follow-up and contact tracing (e.g. to identify and offer testing and treatment to the sexual and needle-sharing partners of people with sexually transmitted infections). There has been disagreement over whether unique identifi ers can be used instead of names. Unique identifi ers are expensive to cre- ate and, if constructed in a fashion that allows accurate data linkage, could easily be linked back to names. Some countries experimented with coded reporting for HIV infection before ultimately adopting nominative systems. While such systems were initially the only politically viable solution, they were abandoned when they were found not to meet federal funding standards for reliability and validity. However, technological advances have created new possibilities. Digital data can be scrambled and encrypted into unique identifi ers that are perhaps impossible to trace back to individu- als.

How should such risks be balanced against population level benefi ts? - When and how must relevant communities be engaged in the development of surveillance plans? - How should the confi dentiality of surveillance data be protected? - What are the ethical obligations to share relevant public health surveillance data across public health authorities? With public health researchers? With communities and individuals who have contributed to surveillance systems? - Are there circumstances when data sharing must be strictly prohibited? - What institutional mechanisms should be established to ensure ethical issues are systematically addressed prior to data collection, use, and dissemination? These are core questions that those involved in public health surveillance have grappled with for more than a century. To address these and other pressing concerns an international group of experts has developed the WHO Guidelines on Ethical Issues in Public Health Surveillance. Based on a set of core ethical and policy considerations, these 17 guidelines establish the affi rmative duties to undertake surveillance, share data, and engage communities, while recognizing the limits of surveillance. They will be applied in situations characterized by fundamental cultural, economic, and political variability. The goal, therefore, is to enable critical discussion about legitimate ethical tensions and trade-offs and the appropriate governance and oversight of surveillance.

For this reason, medicinal plants have been used therapeutically all around the world, being an important aspect of various traditional medicine systems. From Ayurveda to Chinese traditional medicine, from Unani to Tibetan Medicine, from Amazonian to African Medicine, all systems of traditional medicine, although based on different theoretical and cultural models, integrate phytotherapy into their doctrine. In high-income countries, the widespread use of phytotherapy declined at the end of the fi rst part of the twentieth century, due to the development and production of synthetic medicines. During the past few decades, however, phytotherapy has started to be increasingly used even in industrialized countries. In low- and middle-income countries, phytotherapy never stopped being important, often representing the only therapeutic system to which certain people could refer. In facing this challenge, it is fundamental that the conditions for the correct and appropriate use of phytotherapy methods are in place. If correctly applied, these methods can contribute to protecting and improving citizens’ health and well- being. The correct use of such methods should follow the criteria of safety, effi cacy and quality. These principles characterize modern medical practice and are at the basis of consumer protection. The work of the Regional Government of Lombardy in the fi eld of traditional and complementary and alternative medicine (TM/CAM) has been guided by the", "page_start": 6, "page_end": 8, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

If correctly applied, these methods can contribute to protecting and improving citizens’ health and well- being. The correct use of such methods should follow the criteria of safety, effi cacy and quality. These principles characterize modern medical practice and are at the basis of consumer protection. The work of the Regional Government of Lombardy in the fi eld of traditional and complementary and alternative medicine (TM/CAM) has been guided by the above-mentioned criteria. TM/CAM was included in the Regional Health Plan (2002–2004). Along these lines, a series of governmental provisions has defi ned a framework for the protection of consumers and providers. The keystone of this process is the Quadrennial Cooperation Plan between the Regional Government of Lombardy and the World Health Organization (WHO) on the use and evaluation of TM/CAM. Furthermore, the promotion of clinical and observational studies on Lombardy territory has been a crucial step in the evaluation of the effi cacy of TM/CAM. As mentioned above, phytotherapy is highly diffused in high-income countries, but the scientifi c medical model is more diffused in the developing countries. This contact between the two models has raised the urgent need to compare the immense background of traditional knowledge with the scientifi c procedures of research and validation. This process is aimed at demonstrating the safety and effi cacy of single or combined medicines that have been used in the past millennia. In this respect, the Regional Government of Lombardy shares WHO’s concern to prove not only the safety but also the effi cacy of phytotherapeutic medicines. This is especially true for those countries where the primary or prevalent system is conventional medicine, and where phytotherapy could substitute medicines vii WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues whose effi cacy has already been verifi ed. In these cases, the physician should conduct a careful evaluation of the correlation of the effi cacy and safety of the herbal medicine compared with the chemical medicines that are to be substituted by the herbal medicine. For all these reasons, it is evident that the diffusion of phytotherapy in developed countries requires a series of extended studies aimed at establishing the safety and the effi cacy of commonly used herbal medicines. Concerted action by different specialists is needed in order to translate the use, often safe, of the traditional recipes to industrial societies. However, the use of phytotherapy according to the effi cacy and safety criteria is not suffi cient to guarantee the quality of both the herbal medicine and its use. Products with high quality standards are needed to allow the patient to make safe use of phytotherapeutic products. Nowadays, as a consequence of market globalization, many of the medicines used in the phytotherapeutic systems do not come from the country of origin but from third countries.

Products with high quality standards are needed to allow the patient to make safe use of phytotherapeutic products. Nowadays, as a consequence of market globalization, many of the medicines used in the phytotherapeutic systems do not come from the country of origin but from third countries. A set of regulations shared at the global level is crucial to guarantee high quality standards for medicinal plants. The legislative framework should establish the basic parameters to guarantee quality and safety in the use of phytotherapeutic products. Led by this vision, experts from around the world participated in the WHO Consultation on Contaminants and Residues held from 12–14 July 2004 in Loveno di Menaggio and produced the present document. This work could be a model for other regulations on the quality of medicinal plants, and should be a reference point for providers, and for political and administrative authorities that desire that phytotherapy be of help in promoting citizens’ health according to the safety and effi cacy criteria. Luciano Bresciani Regional Minister of Health Regional Government of Lombardy Gian Carlo Abelli Regional Minister of Family and Social Solidarity Regional Government of Lombardy viii Preface Preface With the ever-increasing use of herbal medicines and the global expansion of the herbal medicines market, safety has become a major concern for both health authorities and the public in many Member States. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a strategy on traditional medicines for the period 2002–2005 (WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy: 2002–2005), and this was subsequently implemented under the WHO Medicines Strategy covering the period 2004– 2007. One of the major objectives is to promote the safety, effi cacy and quality of traditional medicines. The quality of herbal medicines has a direct impact on their safety and effi cacy. There are many control measures for herbal medicines, and the fi rst important step is to control the quality of medicinal plants and herbal materials. However, this is a very complicated and diffi cult task as it involves many different areas, such as the environment and agricultural practices. It is well known that there are many contaminants and residues that may cause harm to the consumers of herbal medicines. Many are natural, such as naturally occurring radionuclides, toxic metals or bacteria. Some arise from past or present use of agents or materials that pollute the environment and subsequently medicinal plants, such as emissions from factories or the residues of certain pesticides. Recent research has also demonstrated that herbs may absorb heavy metals during growth. For these reasons, there is currently a potential global danger to the health and well-being of people. This risk can be reduced by ensuring that herbal medicines with harmful contaminants and residues do not reach the public, by assessing the quality of the medicinal plants, herbal materials and fi nished herbal products before they reach the market. WHO has developed a series of technical guidelines and documents relating to the safety and", "page_start": 9, "page_end": 10, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

This risk can be reduced by ensuring that herbal medicines with harmful contaminants and residues do not reach the public, by assessing the quality of the medicinal plants, herbal materials and fi nished herbal products before they reach the market. WHO has developed a series of technical guidelines and documents relating to the safety and quality assurance of medicinal plants and herbal materials. These include, Guidelines on good agricultural and collection practices (GACP) for medicinal plants and Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials. The above-mentioned WHO technical documents have introduced some commonly used methods to determine biological, chemical and radionuclear contaminants, as well as pesticide residues. However these documents tend to focus on technical issues related to the quality control of herbal materials and medicinal plants, and although they mention methods for the determination of contaminants, they do not go into great detail. The document on Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials was developed a long time ago, at a time when there was a lack of appropriate test methods and a lack of national and regional quality specifi cation standards on specifi c contaminants and residues. Therefore, it has become necessary, and also possible, to develop these new guidelines, which focus on providing technical guidance on the assessment of quality of herbal medicines, related to both major and common contaminants and residues, based on countries’ efforts, technical advancement and recent developments. ix WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues Herbal materials and medicinal plants are also often used as food, functional food, nutritional or dietary supplements. The results of the WHO global survey on national policy and regulation of herbal medicines (2005) showed that in more than 100 responding countries, the regulatory status most often given to herbal medicines is as over-the-counter medicines, prescription medicines or as dietary supplements and health food. Hence, in some countries, there is a saying: “medicines and foods have the same origin”. It is clear that quality control of herbal materials and medicinal plants is very important, not only for the safety of the herbal medicines themselves, but also for food safety. Therefore, much of the work undertaken in the area of food safety is relevant to the safety of herbal medicines. Hence, the development of these guidelines was initiated as a joint effort between the teams of Traditional Medicine and Food Safety, in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the WHO Joint Programme: Codex Alimentarius. Here it should be emphasized that due to lack of research data and technical limitations at present, many of the accepted limits in the guidelines are referenced and extrapolated from work done in the food area.

It should be borne in mind that although controlling the contaminants and residues in food and in herbal medicines has certain similarities, there may also be many differences. Therefore, more research is needed in order to establish the scientifi c criteria for herbal medicines. The Traditional Medicine team has not only cooperated with the WHO Food Safety Programme, but also with other relevant WHO departments and technical units such as the Department of Protection of the Human Environment and the Department of Policy and Standards of Medicines at WHO Headquarters in Geneva. The validated test methods and standards related to the determination of contaminants and residues described in these guidelines were adopted, after extensive technical review, from some existing WHO guidelines and technical documents in the fi eld of herbal medicines and traditional medicine, particularly from the Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials and also from documents in the areas of food safety, chemical safety, control of communicable diseases, and radiation and environmental health as well as from some national, regional and international pharmacopoeias. These recommended analytical methods, procedures and standards were fi nally reviewed during the meetings of the WHO Expert Committee on Pharmaceutical Specifi cations in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Although the guidelines include many new validated analytical methods involving new technologies, they do not cover every complicated situation and technical demand for controlling contaminants and residues of herbal medicines. WHO will continue to cooperate with Member States and other relevant technical programmes within WHO to update the guidelines to take into account the development of new technologies and methods, to promote quality control of herbal medicines and to ensure the safety and effi cacy of the use of traditional medicines. Dr Xiaorui Zhang Coordinator Traditional Medicine Department of Technical Cooperation for Essential Drugs and Traditional Medicine xx Introduction 1. Introduction 1.1 Background With the ever-increasing use of herbal medicines worldwide and the rapid expansion of the global market for these products, the safety and quality of medicinal plant materials and fi nished herbal medicinal products have become a major concern for health authorities, pharmaceutical industries and the public. National regulation and registration of herbal medicines varies from country to country. Where herbal medicines are regulated, they are categorized either as prescription medicines or non-prescription medicines. Within a country, a group of herbal products categorized other than as medicines may coexist. Herbal products categorized other than as medicines and foods, are becoming increasingly popular and there is potential for adverse events due to lack of regulation, weak quality control systems and loose distribution channels (including mail order and Internet sales).

Herbal products categorized other than as medicines and foods, are becoming increasingly popular and there is potential for adverse events due to lack of regulation, weak quality control systems and loose distribution channels (including mail order and Internet sales). A resolution on traditional medicine (WHA56.31) adopted by the 56th session of the World Health Assembly in May 2003, urges Member States, where appropriate, to ensure safety, effi cacy and quality of herbal medicines by determining national standards for, or issuing monographs on, herbal raw materials and traditional medicine formulae. It also requested the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide technical support for the development of methodology to monitor or ensure product quality, effi cacy and safety, preparation of guidelines and promotion of exchange of information. The International Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities (ICDRA) at its 9th, 10th and 11th meetings and the Meeting of the National Centres Participating in the WHO Drug Monitoring Programme requested WHO to develop and constantly update the technical guidelines on quality, safety and effi cacy of herbal medicines. The participants at the WHO informal meeting on methodologies for quality control of fi nished herbal products, held in Ottawa, Canada, 20–21 July 2001, also reviewed the entire production process of herbal medicines, from raw materials to distribution and supply of fi nished herbal products. Recommendations from this meeting led to the development of these general guidelines addressing the important issue of safety and quality of herbal medicines with special reference to contaminants and residues. In ensuring the quality and safety of herbal medicines, the national authorities in many Member States as well as other stakeholders in provision of herbal medicines are likely to encounter numerous challenges, including the setting of standards for quality, their adoption, monitoring and enforcement. The national policy and regulations that are likely to be developed using these WHO guidelines, should also take into account all local and other special needs. Methods, both general 1 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues and specifi c, for the determination of the various standards and values are also suggested in this document. In the absence of relevant and appropriate national standards, there is a risk that these herbal medicines may be lost to traditional users and become unavailable to new users for many reasons. These reasons include: their failing to meet various trade, registration, import and export requirements; loss of confi dence in these products due to the presence of real or perceived health risks; and increased reporting of adverse events involving use of these herbal medicines. From time to time, undesirable and/or undeclared substances have been present or have been purported to be present in herbal medicines or medicinal plants in many parts of the world.

From time to time, undesirable and/or undeclared substances have been present or have been purported to be present in herbal medicines or medicinal plants in many parts of the world. These substances have included pesticides, radioactive particles, and microbes including pathogens, mycotoxins, heavy metals and arsenic. In order to reduce the risk of adverse events attributable to unsafe and poor-quality herbal medicines, WHO has committed to developing a series of new technical guidelines relating to the safety and quality assurance of herbal medicines, and to updating existing technical documents in this fi eld. These actions implement parts of the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy: 2002–2005 (1). Within the overall context of quality control of herbal medicines, WHO has also developed general global guidelines for assessing the safety of potentially hazardous substances in herbal medicines, with particular reference to biological, chemical, and radioactive contaminants, and pesticide residues. 1.2 Purpose and objectives Within the overall context of quality assurance, these guidelines are primarily intended to provide general technical guidance to Member States in the assessment of quality related to safety of herbal medicines with regard to both major and common contaminants and residues. These guidelines may need to be adjusted according to each country’s situation. The objectives of these guidelines are to provide: - guiding principles for assessing the quality in relation to the safety of herbal medicines, with specifi c reference to contaminants and residues; - model criteria for use in identifying possible contaminants and residues; - examples of methods and techniques; and - examples of practical technical procedures for controlling the quality of fi nished herbal products. In the pursuit of the above-mentioned objectives, these guidelines should be read together with the other WHO documents and publications (including future versions) relating to the quality assurance of herbal medicines with regard to safety, for example (for details see reference list): - Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials (2) - Good agricultural and collection practices (GACP) for medicinal plants (3) - International pharmacopoeia, 4th ed. (4, 5) 2 Introduction - Good manufacturing practices: main principles for pharmaceutical products (6) - Good manufacturing practices: supplementary guidelines for the manufacture of herbal medicinal products (7) - Guide to good storage practices for pharmaceuticals (8) - Good trade and distribution practices (GTDP) for pharmaceutical starting materials (9) - General guidelines for methodologies on research and evaluation of traditional medicine (10) - Guidelines for assessment of herbal medicines (11) - WHO monographs on selected medicinal plants (12, 13).

Also, as much of the work in the fi eld of food safety is relevant to the safety of herbal medicines, these guidelines should be reviewed together with the relevant guidelines and codes of practice developed by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, particularly those of its Committees on Pesticide Residues and on Food Additives and Contaminants, which are often refl ected in national legislation. Thus medicinal plants may be subject to the general requirements for foods. Examples of Codex texts, which may be applicable to medicinal plants, include: - Codex Alimentarius code of practice, general principles of food hygiene (14) - Codex Alimentarius guidelines for the production, processing, labelling and marketing of organically produced foods (15) - Codex Alimentarius code of practice for spices and dried aromatic plants (16). The scope of these guidelines does not cover issues of adulteration of herbal medicines and/or counterfeit products, which should be dealt with in separate guidelines. WHO has produced guidelines on counterfeits in general (8, 9, 17– 20). 1.3 Use of the document A rapid increase in the global use of herbal medicines over the last few years has led to concerns over the safety and quality of herbal materials and herbal products. Currently, there is considerable variation from country to country in the quality control of such materials and products and this variation not only impacts on public health, as contaminants in herbal medicines may represent avoidable risks for patients and consumers, but also has effects on international trade. Thus implementation of testing for contaminants in the national and/or regional quality control of herbal medicines is highly recommended and it is the intention of this document to provide guidance on which aspects should be considered when implementing such tests. In particular: - Consideration should be given to potential risk factors that might have an impact on possible contamination. For example, testing for radioactive contaminants will be necessary only if there are special reasons for concern. However, it should be noted that even if a herb is organically or “biologically” grown, contaminants from the soil or other environmental sources may still be present. 3 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues - Not all tests have to be performed on every production batch. For example, if it has been shown that pesticides will not concentrate during an extraction process, it will be suffi cient to test the herbal material. - Some analytical methods require signifi cant investment in instruments and reagents. However, economic constraints should not prevent the implementation of testing for contaminants. If resources are insuffi cient, the establishment of a national or regional pesticide control laboratory could be a suitable solution and cooperation with laboratories from academia or", "page_start": 14, "page_end": 15, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

If resources are insuffi cient, the establishment of a national or regional pesticide control laboratory could be a suitable solution and cooperation with laboratories from academia or research centres, or with specialized laboratories working in food-related areas should be considered. These guidelines mention several potential major contaminants and residues and Member States are advised to prioritize their testing programmes according to local agricultural practice and, in the case of imports, the agricultural practices of the source country. The annexes to these guidelines present several examples of suitable methodologies found in national or regional pharmacopoeias and in WHO documents. It should be noted that these methods need to be validated for the material that is to be tested, e.g. roots, seeds, leaves, plant species and also for each type of instrument, e.g. for gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or atomic absorption (AA) spectrophotometry. This process should include validation of detection limits, as these may depend on the instrument and type of sample. It is recommended that Member States and WHO work together to improve these methods and to harmonize requirements with a view to including validated standard methods in the International pharmacopoeia and regional pharmacopoeias. Many of the accepted limits are extrapolated from work done in the food area, therefore more research is needed on the establishment of the scientifi c basis (e.g. for maximum residue limit (MRL) values for herbal medicines or herbal materials in general). The guidelines are a living document and will be revised and updated in the light of further developments and new technologies as they become available in the future. It is important that the WHO Member States adopt the document as a working document in their regulatory controls. The Member States are encouraged to make free use of this document and incorporate it into their legal framework. 1.4 Glossary The following terms are used in the guidelines. The numbers in parentheses following a term refer to the number of the publication as given in the reference list; sometimes it was necessary to adapt the defi nitions so that they would apply properly to herbal medicines.

However, one of the purposes of these defi nitions is to provide consistency in terminology with other relevant WHO documents in this fi eld, such as the WHO General guidelines for methodologies on research and evaluation of traditional medicine (10) and WHO Good manufacturing practices (6, 7). It should also be noted that these defi nitions have been developed to meet the demand for the establishment of standard, internationally acceptable defi nitions to be used in the evaluation and research of herbal medicines (10). Herbal medicines (10) These include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and fi nished herbal products: Herbs (10) Herbs include crude plant material such as leaves, fl owers, fruit, seeds, stems, wood, bark, roots, rhizomes or other plant parts, which may be entire, fragmented or powdered. Herbal materials (10) Herbal materials are either whole plants or parts of medicinal plants in the crude state. They include herbs, fresh juices, gums, fi xed oils, essential oils, resins and dry powders of herbs. In some countries, these materials may be processed by various local procedures, such as steaming, roasting, or stir baking with honey, alcoholic beverages or other materials.1 Herbal preparations (10) Herbal preparations are the basis for fi nished herbal products and may include comminuted or powdered herbal materials, or extracts, tinctures and fatty oils, expressed juices and processed exudates of herbal materials. They are produced with the aid of extraction, distillation, expression, fractionation, purifi cation, concentration, fermentation or other physical or biological processes. They also include preparations made by steeping or heating herbal materials in alcoholic beverages and/or honey, or in other materials. Finished herbal products or herbal medicinal products (10) Medicinal products containing as active substances exclusively herbal drugs or herbal drug preparations. They may consist of herbal preparations made from one or more herbs. If more than one herb is used, the term mixed herbal product can also be used. They may contain excipients in addition to the active ingredients. In some countries herbal medicines may contain, by tradition, natural organic or inorganic active ingredients, which are not of plant origin (e.g. animal materials and mineral materials). Generally however, fi nished products or mixed products to which chemically defi ned active substances have been added, including synthetic compounds and/ or isolated constituents from herbal materials, are not considered to be herbal. 1 The wording of this defi nition has been modifi ed from the original which appeared in reference (10). 5 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues Medicinal plant materials:see Herbal materials Medicinal plant (7) A plant, either growing wild or cultivated, used for its medicinal purposes. 1.4.2 Terms relating to", "page_start": 16, "page_end": 17, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

Thus when Member States consider the terms relevant to their individual needs, these documents should be consulted. The reason for this suggestion is that in future the Joint FAO/WHO Meetings on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) will probably continue as the group mandated to evaluate the safety of pesticides and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) for contaminants in herbal medicines and in foods. The defi nitions contained in this glossary were originally quoted from various documents listed above; however, they were modifi ed at the WHO Consultation on Contaminants and Residues to adapt them to the scope of this document. In general when countries are setting standards for their herbal medicines they should take into account the differences in dosages, quantities and frequency of use, and methods of preparation of herbal medicines relative to those of foods. Contamination(6) The undesired introduction of impurities of a chemical or microbiological nature, or of foreign matter, into or onto a starting material, intermediate product or fi nished herbal product during production, sampling, packaging or repackaging, storage or transport. Cross-contamination (6) The contamination of a starting material, intermediate product or fi nished product with another starting material or product during production. Foreign matter (2) Material consisting of any or all of the following: - parts of the medicinal plant material or materials other than those named with the limits specifi ed for the plant material concerned; - any organism, part or product of an organism, other than that named in the specifi cation and description of the plant material concerned; - mineral admixtures such as soil, stones, sand, and dust; and glass, metal and plastics or any other extraneous materials. These may be loose or adhering to these medicinal plant materials. Acceptable daily intake (ADI) of a chemical (21) The estimated maximum amount of an agent, expressed on a body mass basis, to which an individual in a (sub)population may be exposed daily over his or 6 Introduction her lifetime without appreciable health risk. ADIs are normally determined for substances that are deliberately added (to foods) or are residues that are present as a result of approved uses of the agent.

ADIs are normally determined for substances that are deliberately added (to foods) or are residues that are present as a result of approved uses of the agent. A daily intake, which, during an entire lifetime, appears to be without appreciable risk to the health of the consumer, on the basis of all the known facts at the time of the evaluation of the chemical by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues. It is expressed in milligrams of the chemical per kilogram of body weight.1 Acceptable residue level (ARL) (21) The ARL is given in mg of pesticide per kg of medicinal plant material and can be calculated from the maximum acceptable daily intake (ADI) of the pesticide for humans, as recommended by FAO and WHO, and the mean daily intake (MDI) of the medicinal plant material. Acute reference dose (ARD) (21) The acute reference dose of a chemical is an estimate of the amount of a substance, normally expressed on a body-weight basis, that can be ingested in a period of 24 hours or less without appreciable health risk to the consumer on the basis of all known facts at the time of the evaluation. ARD is the amount of pesticide to which a person is exposed, usually, at one day’s regimen of herbal medicines and which results in acute effects on the human body. ARD estimations include a safety factor to ensure that the elderly, infants, children and those whose systems are under stress because of illness, are protected. Extraneous maximum residue limit (EMRL) (21) A pesticide residue or a contaminant arising from environmental sources (including former agricultural uses) other than the use of a pesticide or contaminant substance directly or indirectly on the herbal medicine. The concentration is expressed in milligrams of pesticide residue or contaminant per kilogram of the herbal medicine. Maximum residue limit (MRL) (21) The MRL is the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue (expressed as mg/ kg) recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission to be legally permitted (in food commodities and animal feeds). MRLs are based on good agricultural practices (GAP) data established for foods, and foods derived from commodities that comply with the respective MRLs are intended to be toxicologically acceptable. Such MRL values might be used by analogy for herbal medicines. MRLs which are primarily intended to apply in international trade are derived from estimations made by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) following: 1 For additional information on ADIs relative to pesticide residues refer to the Report of the 1975 Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues, FAO Plant Production and Protection Series No. 1 or WHO Technical Report Series No. 592. 7 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines", "page_start": 18, "page_end": 19, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

Data from supervised trials conducted at the highest nationally recommended, authorized or registered uses are usually included in the review. - Consideration of the various dietary residue estimates and determinations both at the national and international levels in comparison with the ADI, should indicate that herbal medicines complying with MRLs proposed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission are safe for human consumption. - In order to accommodate variations in national pest control requirements, Codex MRLs take into account the higher levels shown to arise in such supervised trials, which are considered to represent effective pest control practices. For herbal medicines, the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission to be legally permitted in food commodities or in animal feeds could be applicable to herbal materials/preparations. Generally MRLs would be based on GAPdata and are intended to be toxicologically acceptable. GAP includes the nationally authorized safe uses of pesticides under actual conditions necessary for effective and reliable pest control. It encompasses a range of levels of pesticide applications up to the highest authorized use, applied in a manner which leaves a residue that is the smallest amount practicable. Authorized safe uses are determined at the national level and include nationally registered or recommended uses, which take into account public and occupational health and environmental safety considerations. GAP applies at all stages of production, storage, transport, distribution and processing of herbal medicines. Permitted daily exposure The term “permitted daily exposure” (PDE) is defi ned, in the ICH guidelines, as a pharmaceutically acceptable intake of residual solvents to avoid confusion of differing ADIs for the same substance (22).1 Pesticide For the purpose of these guidelines, pesticides are defi ned as any substance intended for preventing, destroying, attracting, repelling, or controlling any pest including unwanted species of plants or animals during production, storage, transport, distribution and processing. The term includes substances intended for use as a plant-growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant, fruit thinning agent, or sprouting inhibitor and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport. The term normally excludes fertilizers and plant nutrients.

With the evidence of long- range transport of these substances to regions where they have never been used or produced and the consequent threats they pose to the environment of the whole globe, the international community has, on several occasions, called for urgent global action to reduce and eliminate releases of these chemicals.1 Tolerable intake (TI) – general defi nition Tolerable intake is defi ned as an estimate of the intake of a substance over a lifetime that is considered to be without appreciable health risk (23).2 TI of a contaminant In the context of the present guidelines, the TI is defi ned as the estimated amount of a contaminant, expressed on a body mass basis, to which each individual in a (sub)population may be exposed over a specifi ed period without appreciable risk. The term “tolerable” is used for agents which are not deliberately added, such as contaminants. TI of pesticide as a contaminant in herbal products The estimated amount of pesticide consumed as a contaminant in herbal products, together with other sources over a period of time, ranging from daily to lifetime, without causing harm to humans. Residual solvents These are residues of organic solvents that are used or produced in the manufacture of and processing of herbal preparations/products. Solvents are classifi ed by the ICH (CPMP/ICH 283/95) according to their potential risk into: - class 1 (solvents to be avoided such as benzene); - class 2 (limited toxic potential such as methanol or hexane); and - 3 (low toxic potential such as ethanol). 1 United Nations Environment Programme (http://www.chem.unep.ch/pops/default.html). 2 http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc170.htm#SectionNumber:2.2 9 Potentially hazardous contaminants and residues in herbal medicines 2. Potentially hazardous contaminants and residues in herbal medicines 2.1 General considerations Herbal medicines are defi ned as herbal products in the medicines category in a national drug regulatory framework, and may include “herbs”, “herbal materials”, “herbal preparations” and “fi nished herbal products”/“herbal medicinal products”.

In some countries, certain herbs and herbal materials may also be used as foods or as ingredients of foods. For this reason, the following terms have been adapted accordingly to address both regulatory categories of herbal medicines and food. Table 1 shows examples of potentially hazardous contaminants and residues that may occur in herbal medicines. The summary table includes information on possible sources of contaminants and residues, as well as the manufacturing stages at which they may be detectable. Some of them are considered as unavoidable contaminants or residues of herbal medicines. Contaminants in herbal medicines are classifi ed into physicochemical contaminants and biological contaminants. A variety of agrochemical agents and some organic solvents may be important residues in herbal medicines. Contamination should be avoided and controlled through quality assurance measures such as good agricultural and collection practices (GACP) for medicinal plants, and good manufacturing practices (GMP) for herbal medicines. Chemical and microbiological contaminants can result from the use of human excreta, animal manures and sewage as fertilizers. As noted in the WHO guidelines on GACP for medicinal plants (3), human excreta must not be used as a fertilizer, and animal manures should be thoroughly composted. Toxic elements and other chemical contaminants, including solvents originating from products intended for use in households and industrial chemicals, can be concentrated in composted sewage. Therefore, care should also be exercised with sewage management in agricultural areas. Foreign matter should be controlled. By far the majority of potentially hazardous contaminants and residues are found in the herbs and herbal materials. This results in their presence in the products, such as herbal preparations and fi nished herbal medicines. The level of some contaminants and residues present at the stage of the medicinal plant may change as a result of post-harvest processing (e.g. drying), in herbal preparations such as extracts, and in fi nished herbal products during the manufacturing process. Each contaminant and residue is described in the following two subsections. Some concerns have been expressed in connection with the advancement of biotechnology, which, in the future, might be applied to medicinal plants produced using DNA technologies. This is an area that requires continuous monitoring for probable modifi cation and new policy development. This subject, however, is beyond the scope of these guidelines. 11 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues Table 1.

These include environmental pollution (i.e. contaminated emissions from factories and leaded petrol and contaminated water including run- off water which fi nds its way into rivers, lakes and the sea, and some pesticides), soil composition and fertilizers. This contamination of the herbal material leads to contamination of the products during various stages of the manufacturing process. Pesticides containing arsenic and mercury were widely used until a few years ago and they are still being used in some countries. As toxic substances are likely to be present in many foods, due to their abundance in nature, it is important to note that concomitant ingestion of herbal products would add to the total concentration of toxic metals consumed by people, even if best practice guidelines are followed. 2.2.2 Persistent organic pollutants POPs include organic chemicals, such as the synthetic aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are only slightly soluble in water and are persistent or stable in the presence of sunlight, moisture, air and heat. In the past, they were extensively used in agriculture as pesticides. They are still generated", "page_start": 23, "page_end": 24, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

In the past, they were extensively used in agriculture as pesticides. They are still generated inadvertently as by-products of combustion or industrial processes. The use of persistent pesticides, such as DDT and benzene hexachloride (BHC), in agriculture has been banned for many years in many countries. However they are still found in the areas where they were previously used and often contaminate medicinal plants growing nearby. Also many of these substances are still being used for public health purposes, for example the control of disease vectors such as malaria-carrying mosquitoes, and are often applied near agricultural fi elds. The pesticide residues can then drift through the air on to the medicinal plant crops growing in nearby fi elds resulting in their contamination. Thus care should be exercised with checking the quality of the medicinal plants grown in areas where these persistent pesticides are still being used. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants1 currently includes DDT and 11 other POPs including dioxin (a potent carcinogen), aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, mirex, toxaphene and hexachlorobenzene.2 2.2.3 Radioactive contamination A certain amount of exposure to ionizing radiation is unavoidable because many sources, including of radionuclides occur naturally in the ground and the atmosphere (24). 1 http://www.unep.org/themes/chemicals 2 http://www.pops.int/documents/pops/default.htm 13 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues Dangerous contamination may be the consequence of a nuclear accident or may arise from other sources. WHO, in close collaboration with several other international organizations, has developed guidelines for use in the event of widespread contamination by radionuclides resulting from a major nuclear accident (25). Examples of such radionuclides include long-lived and short-lived fi ssion products, actinides and activation products. In general the nature and the intensity of these radionuclides may differ markedly and depends on factors such as the source, which could be a reactor, reprocessing plant, fuel fabrication plant, isotope production unit or other (26). These guidelines emphasize that the health risks posed by herbal medicines accidentally contaminated by radionuclides depend not only on the specifi c radionuclide and the level of contamination, but also on the dose and duration of use of the product consumed. An important consideration in the testing for radioactive substances in herbal materials and products is the availability of the appropriate methodology and equipment. Member States would probably benefi t from collaboration with countries where these facilities are available. Cross-contamination of radionuclide-free herbal materials should be totally avoided during all the stages of production, transportation and storage. 2.2.4 Mycotoxins and endotoxins Mycotoxins The presence of mycotoxins in plant material can pose both acute and chronic risks to", "page_start": 24, "page_end": 25, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

Member States would probably benefi t from collaboration with countries where these facilities are available. Cross-contamination of radionuclide-free herbal materials should be totally avoided during all the stages of production, transportation and storage. 2.2.4 Mycotoxins and endotoxins Mycotoxins The presence of mycotoxins in plant material can pose both acute and chronic risks to health. Mycotoxins are usually secondary metabolic products which are nonvolatile, have a relatively low molecular weight, and may be secreted onto or into the medicinal plant material. They are thought to play a dual role, fi rstly, in eliminating other microorganisms competing in the same environment and secondly, helping parasitic fungi to invade host tissues. Mycotoxins produced by species of fungi including Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium are the most commonly reported. Mycotoxins comprise four main groups, namely, afl atoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins and tricothecenes, all of which have toxic effects. Afl atoxins have been extensively studied and are classifi ed as Group 1 human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (27). Endotoxins Endotoxins are found mainly in the outer membranes of certain Gram-negative bacteria and are released only when the cells are disrupted or destroyed. They are complex lipopolysaccharide molecules that elicit an antigenic response, cause altered resistance to bacterial infections and have other serious effects. Thus tests for their presence on herbal medicines should be performed in dosage forms for parenteral use, in compliance with the requirements of national, regional or international pharmacopoeias. 2.2.5 Solvents occurring as contaminants Solvents used in industries other than the manufacturing of herbal medicines, are often detected as contaminants in water used in irrigation, for drinking and for 14 Potentially hazardous contaminants and residues in herbal medicines industrial purposes and thus they fi nd their way into medicinal plants and herbal materials at various stages of growth and processing. 2.3 Biological contaminants 2.3.1 Microbiological contaminants Herbs and herbal materials normally carry a large number of bacteria and moulds, often originating in soil or derived from manure. While a large range of bacteria and fungi form the naturally occurring microfl ora of medicinal plants, aerobic spore-forming bacteria frequently predominate. Current practices of harvesting, production, transportation and storage may cause additional contamination and microbial growth. Proliferation of microorganisms may result from failure to control the moisture levels of herbal medicines during transportation and storage, as well as from failure to control the temperatures of liquid forms and fi nished herbal products. The presence of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and moulds may indicate poor quality of production and harvesting practices. Microbial contamination may also occur through handling by personnel who are infected with pathogenic bacteria during harvest/collection, post-harvest process- ing and the manufacturing process. This should be controlled by implementing best practice guidelines such as GACP and GMP. 2.3.2 Parasitic contamination Parasites such as protozoa and nematoda, and their ova, may be introduced during cultivation", "page_start": 25, "page_end": 26, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

Microbial contamination may also occur through handling by personnel who are infected with pathogenic bacteria during harvest/collection, post-harvest process- ing and the manufacturing process. This should be controlled by implementing best practice guidelines such as GACP and GMP. 2.3.2 Parasitic contamination Parasites such as protozoa and nematoda, and their ova, may be introduced during cultivation and may cause zoonosis, especially if uncomposted animal excreta are used. Contamination with parasites may also arise during processing and manufacturing if the personnel carrying out these processes have not taken appropriate personal hygiene measures. 2.4 Agrochemical residues The main agrochemical residues in herbal medicines are derived from pesticides and fumigants. Pesticides may be classifi ed on the basis of their intended use, for example as follows: - insecticides; - fungicides and nematocides; - herbicides; and - other pesticides (e.g. ascaricides, molluscicides and rodenticides). Examples of fumigants include ethylene oxide, ethylene chlorohydrin, methyl bromide and sulfur dioxide. 2.4.1 Pesticide residues Medicinal plant materials may contain pesticide residues, which accumulate as a result of agricultural practices, such as spraying, treatment of soils during cultivation and administration of fumigants during storage. It is therefore recommended that 15 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues every country producing medicinal plant materials should have at least one control laboratory capable of performing the determination of pesticides using a suitable method. 2.4.1.1 Classifi cation of pesticides Different classifi cations of pesticides exist (28, 29). A classifi cation based on the chemical composition or structure of the pesticide is the most useful for analytical chemists, for example: - chlorinated hydrocarbons and related pesticides: hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) or benzene hexachloride (BHC), lindane, methoxychlor - chlorinated phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicides: 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T - organophosphorus pesticides: carbophenothion (carbofenotion), chlorpyrifos and methylchlorpyrifos, coumaphos (coumafos), demeton, dichlorvos, dimethoate, ethion, fenchlorphos (fenclofos), malathion, methyl parathion, parathion - carbamate insecticides: carbaryl (carbaril) - carbamoyl benzimidazoles: benomyl, carbendazim - dithiocarbamate fungicides: ferbam, maneb, nabam, thiram, zineb, ziram - amino acid herbicides: glyphosate - inorganic pesticides: aluminium phosphide, calcium arsenate - miscellaneous: bromopropylate, chloropicrin, ethylene dibromide, ethylene oxide, methyl bromide, sulfur dioxide - pesticides of plant origin: tobacco leaf extract, pyrethrum fl ower, and pyrethrum extract; derris and Lonchocarpus root and rotenoids. Only the chlorinated hydrocarbons and related pesticides (e.g. HCH) and a few organophosphorus pesticides (e.g. carbophenothion) have a long residual action. Although the use of many persistent pesticides has been widely discontinued, residues may still remain in the environment (e.g. DDT (see section 2.2.2)). Thus the recording of all pesticide usage in countries should be strongly encouraged so as to enable cost-effective quality control of medicinal plants and of their products. Pesticides based upon copper as the active agent e.g. copper sulfate and mixtures of copper sulfate and hydrated lime were often used in the past and are still popular with farmers today. Such compounds are effective fungicides.", "page_start": 26, "page_end": 27, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

Pesticides based upon copper as the active agent e.g. copper sulfate and mixtures of copper sulfate and hydrated lime were often used in the past and are still popular with farmers today. Such compounds are effective fungicides. Although copper is an essential nutrient for plants its levels must be controlled because if ingested at high levels, around 70 mg/day, it does have serious adverse effects on health. The likelihood of exposure to copper is also heightened by the fact that copper is strongly bioaccumulated in nature and therefore it is likely to persist in herbal materials, similarly to the heavy metals. Most other pesticides have very short residual actions. Therefore it is suggested that, where the length of exposure to pesticides is unknown, the herbal materials should be tested for the presence of organically bound chlorine and phosphorus as a preliminary screening method (see also Annex 6, section 1), which can be useful in predicting where a pesticide might be used. 16 Potentially hazardous contaminants and residues in herbal medicines 2.4.2. Extraneous pesticide residues (see section 2.2.2) 2.5 Residual solvents A range of organic solvents are used for manufacturing herbal medicines, and can be detected as residues of such processing in herbal preparations and fi nished herbal products. They should be controlled through GMP and quality control. Solvents are classifi ed by ICH (CPMP/ICH 283/95), according to their potential risk, into: - class 1 (solvents to be avoided such as benzene); - class 2 (limited toxic potential such as methanol or hexane); and - class 3 (low toxic potential such as ethanol). 17 18 Guiding principles for assessing safety of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues 3. Guiding principles for assessing safety of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues 3.1 General approach – compliance with good practice guidelines Compliance with GACP and GMP is crucial for the production of good quality herbal medicines. The entire production process, starting from cultivation and ending with the sale of the products, must adhere rigorously to these two sets of practices. The contents of these guidelines should therefore be read in conjunction with GACP and GMP in an effort to produce quality products for the local and international markets. 3.2 Foreign matter Foreign matter found in a sample of herbs and herbal materials should not exceed limits set in national, regional or international pharmacopoeias. Foreign matter includes insects and other animal contamination including animal excreta, as well as other species of plants. In general, any substance other than the acceptable sample of good quality medicinal plant material is regarded as foreign matter. A pure sample is seldom found and there is always some foreign matter present. However no poisonous, dangerous or otherwise harmful foreign matter should be", "page_start": 27, "page_end": 30, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

Foreign matter includes insects and other animal contamination including animal excreta, as well as other species of plants. In general, any substance other than the acceptable sample of good quality medicinal plant material is regarded as foreign matter. A pure sample is seldom found and there is always some foreign matter present. However no poisonous, dangerous or otherwise harmful foreign matter should be allowed. Thus following the GACP should help to ensure that contamination is kept to a minimum. Removal of larger pieces of foreign matter from whole and cut plants is often done by hand-sorting after macroscopic examination. Finished products should also be examined for foreign materials. 3.3 Contaminants 3.3.1 Arsenic and toxic metals The maximum amounts of toxic metals and non-metals in medicinal plant materials can be given based on the provisional tolerable intake (PTI) values. These values should be established on a regional or national basis. Examples are given in Annex 3 under Section A.4. The use of herbal medicinal products is not generally expected to contribute signifi cantly to the exposure of the population to heavy metal contaminants. However, it should be understood that the heavy metal content of herbal medicines adds to the burden originating from food so it is recommended that heavy metal contamination is minimized. 19 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues In general it would be desirable to harmonize limits for toxic metals and standards, as this would have many benefi ts including the facilitation of global trade. 3.3.2 Persistent organic pollutants POPs comprise hundreds of chemicals that are not soluble in water and are persistent or stable in the environment. They are often transported globally because of their resistance to breakdown and they have the potential to cause harm to humans and wildlife that ingest them. They will not disappear from our environments in the short term because some are still being produced and used in many countries. Internationally, through the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, efforts are being made to control their production and emission, and to substitute them with other less problematic pesticides. 3.3.3 Radioactive contaminants The amount of exposure to radiation depends on the intake of radionuclides and its signifi cance depends in turn on other variables such as the age, metabolic kinetics and weight of the individual who ingests them (also known as the dose conversion factor). The level of contamination might be reduced during the manufacturing process. Therefore, no limits for radioactive contamination are proposed in these guidelines and herbal materials should be tested on a case-by-case basis according to national and regional standards if there are concerns. In such a process, national regulation on the limits could be set based on risk management, but no risk assessment.1 3.3.4 Microbial toxins Mycotoxins and, when appropriate, endotoxins should be tested for using an appropriately validated and sensitive method, and amounts should", "page_start": 30, "page_end": 31, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

It is recommended that in performing analyses for mycotoxins particular care should be taken, in line with good practice guidelines such as WHO good practices for national pharmaceutical control laboratories (30). 3.3.5 Microbiological contaminants 3.3.5.1 Bacteria Salmonella and Shigella species must not be present in herbal medicines intended for internal use, at any stage. Other microorganisms should be tested for and should comply with limits set out in regional, national or international pharmacopoeias. Different pharmacopoeias have different testing requirements and these should be consulted when making the appropriate choice for the selected herbal materials and herbal product. 1 Offi ce for Offi cial Publications of the European Communities, Council Regulation (EEC). No. 737/90 of 22 March 1990 on the conditions governing import of agricultural products originating in third countries following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. 20 Guiding principles for assessing safety of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues 3.4 Residues 3.4.1 Pesticide residues Limits for pesticide residues should be established following the recommendations of the JMPR which have already been established for food and animal feed (26). These recommendations include an ADI and the analytical methodology for the assessment of specifi c pesticide residues. Currently however there are no standard procedures for assignment of these MRLs in the medicinal plant area and thus the methods used for foods could probably be used for the preparation of a model. This approach would apply in the case where a botanically identical medicinal plant is used as food. Historically the FAO and WHO have established MRLs, based on supervised trials and establishment of GAP (21) for the use of pesticides for a variety of food commodities and combinations of pesticides and food commodities. If the listed food commodity (name of the original plant and the part of it used as food) is botanically identical to the medicinal plant part concerned and has an established MRL for a specifi c pesticide, the relevant MRL could be regarded as the MRL for the specifi c raw medicinal plant material. In this case, the MRL for the medicinal plant material in question could be further elaborated by establishing an appropriate formula to factor in drying of the plant material. The Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted a list of approved pesticides for spices and their MRLs as shown in Table 4 (see section 4.5) (31).1 If the medicinal plant in question is identical to the plant, but the part concerned is different", "page_start": 31, "page_end": 32, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

In the absence of a full risk assessment and for practical reasons, it is recommended that, in general, the intake of residues from herbal materials should account for no more than 1% of total intake from all sources, including food and drinking-water (2). Since the level of pesticide residues may change during the production process, it is vital to determine the actual quantity of residues consumed in the fi nal dosage form. Because herbal medicines may be used for treatment of chronic diseases or for prophylactic reasons, it is suggested that the approach of the FAO in determining MRLs should be followed. 3.4.1.2 Acceptable residue level An ARL (in mg of pesticide per kg of medicinal plant material) can be calculated on the basis of the maximum ADI of the pesticide for humans, as, recommended by FAO and WHO, and the meandaily intake (MDI) of the medicinal plant material. 1 http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/report/644/al28_41e.pdf 21 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues Some countries and/or regions have established national requirements for residue limits in medicinal plant materials. If no such requirements exist, other references can be consulted, such as other pharmacopoeias or published documents. The appropriateness of risk assessment using the ARL needs further investigation and research. Examples are given in Annex 6 under Section 4.

It is suggested that for these compounds, EMRLs be established instead of MRLs in the same manner as for other pesticides for food commodities.1 3.4.3 Residual solvents The term “permitted daily exposure” (PDE) is proposed as defi ning a pharmaceutically acceptable intake of residual solvents to avoid confusion resulting from differing values for ADIs of the same substance (22).2 1 Codex Alimentarius Commission, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health OrganizationCLPR 03/15. 2 http://www.ich.org/cache/compo/363-272-1.html#Q3C 22 Recommended analytical methods 4. Recommended analytical methods The test methods described here are presented as examples of suitable methods for the detection of selected contaminants and residues in herbal medicines, mainly for herbal materials. Where available, test methods applicable to different products and stages of herbal medicines, such as extracts and fi nished herbal products, are also described. In addition to the test methods, some examples of national experience regarding general limits for contaminants and residues are included, where applicable. Both should be considered as the basis for establishing national and regional requirements for limits and methodologies. WHO is currently not able to recommend limits for contaminants and residues because they are too diverse and there is a lack of consensus. Also the test procedures cannot take into account all possible impurities, but where impurities are known to occur, validated methods should be developed. The test methods should be used where appropriate, only at certain stages, and on a case-by-case basis. The analysis of herbal medicines is not restricted to those methods discussed or recommended here and other techniques are also available. Details of analytical methods, such as volumetric analysis, are described in international pharmacopoeias (4, 5). When considering the choice of method, the level of detection and the plant product matrix used for the testing, e.g. seeds containing oils or fi nished products, must be taken into account, and the method modifi ed if required. The method of determination should be validated for the relevant matrix. Although selected methods are described in detail in the annexes to this document, they may not necessarily be the most modern or state-of-the-art methods.

They do offer some options and guidance, but the available technology and resources, including human and fi nancial, may infl uence their use in particular countries. In the event of limitations precluding the required analytical services for herbal products in a particular district(s) in a country, it is recommended that at least other national or regional offi cial laboratories be made available for such purposes. The guidance of good practices for national pharmaceutical control laboratories, including quality assurance measures, should be followed when methods are chosen for all analyses. All methods chosen should be properly validated in accordance with these good practices (30). The annexes cover the following: - Annex 3 – determination of arsenic and toxic metals - Annex 4 – determination of afl atoxins - Annex 5 – determination of microorganisms 23 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues - Annex 6 – determination of pesticide residues - Annex 7 – list of culture media and strains - Annex 8 – list of reagents and solutions. 4.1 Determination of arsenic and toxic metals (Annex 3) In general, quantitative tests and limit tests accurately determine the concentrations of toxic metals in the form of impurities and contaminants. The latter are unavoidably present in the samples being tested i.e. herbal medicines and their herbal products. Member States can elect to use either quantitative tests or limit tests and their choices will be infl uenced by the nature of the sample and the contaminants or residues, assessed on a case-by-case basis. Another factor would be that the method(s) identifi ed, and chosen to be applied to control heavy metals, should be relevant and should meet the requirements at a regional and national level. Some examples of proposed national limits for arsenic and toxic metals in various types of herbal products are shown in Table 2. Country fi gures are based on information provided by national health authorities. Table 2.

In general, during analysis of metals, one should always aim to use the best and latest methods whenever possible. However it is crucial to ensure that all methods are fully validated, not forgetting the need to validate the integrity of the starting matrix of plant product. This imperative should apply both to governments and companies/applicants submitting these methods as part of their applications to the national regulatory authority for market authorization. Limit tests fi nd wide application in the area of pharmaceutical medicines where it is common to test for substances such as chlorides, sulfates, arsenic and heavy metals. Thus they will be very useful in the testing of herbal medicines and their products. Limit tests can also be modifi ed in many instances to function as true limit tests where the actual amount of toxic metal can be estimated with great accuracy. The need for the inclusion of tests for toxic metals and acceptance criteria should be studied at the various developmental stages of the plant and based on knowledge of the medicinal plant species, its growth and or cultivation and the manufacturing process. The choice of procedures for control should take account of this information: the choice between a limit test and a specifi c quantitative method will depend on the level of control required for a particular material, for example starting material, and should be justifi ed. In general, if the heavy metals burden of the herbal material is unknown, it is suggested that it be determined qualitatively and quantitatively on several batches, preferably collected over several years. These data should be used to establish acceptance limits that should be checked by appropriate limit tests. 4.2 Determination of radioactive contaminants 4.2.1 Method of measurement Following a severe nuclear accident, the environment may be contaminated with airborne radioactive materials.

These may deposit on the leaves of medicinal plants. Their activity concentration and the type of radioactive contamination can be measured by the radiation monitoring laboratories of most of the WHO Member States. The activity concentration of radioisotopes in herbs should be assessed by the competent national radiohygiene laboratories taking into account the relevant recommendations of international organizations, such as Codex Alimentarius, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), FAO and WHO. Since radionuclides from accidental discharges vary with the type of facility involved, a generalized method of measurement is not yet available. However, should such contamination be a concern, suspect samples can be analysed by a competent laboratory. Details of laboratory techniques are available from the IAEA.1 1 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Analytical Quality Control Services, Laboratory Seibersdorf, PO Box 100, Vienna, Austria. 25 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues 4.3 Determination of afl atoxins (Annex 4) Determination of afl atoxins should take place after using a suitable clean-up procedure, during which great care should be taken not to become exposed or to expose the working or general environment to these dangerous and toxic substances. Thus Member States should adapt their good practices for national pharmaceutical control laboratories and GMP accordingly. Only products that have a history of afl atoxin contamination need to be tested. There are specifi c sampling problems especially of afl atoxins due to the way in which contamination spreads, as described for some food commodities, such as nuts and corn. This may need to be taken into consideration when sampling, for example in terms of sample selection and sample size, and when the analysis is made (33, 34). Tests for afl atoxins are designed to detect the possible presence of afl atoxins B , B , 1 2 G and G , which are highly toxic contaminants in any material of plant origin. 1 2 Some examples of proposed national limits for afl atoxin in various types of herbal products are presented in Box 1 below.

Any glassware used in the tests should be of suitable quality. Graduated and volumetric vessels should be calibrated at room temperature. When a water-bath is referred to in the text, a bath containing boiling water (about 100 °C) is to be used, unless a specifi c water temperature is given. Unless otherwise specifi ed, all solutions indicated in the tests are prepared with distilled or demineralized water of adequate purity. Reagents and solutions Reagents and solutions used must conform to the requirements specifi ed in annex 8 “Reagents and solutions”, and are designated as follows: reagent, R; test solution, TS; volumetric solution, VS. Precision of measurement Quantities and volumes The quantities and volumes of the materials and reagents used in the tests must be measured with adequate precision, which is indicated in the following way: A value of: 20.0 means not less than 19.5 and not more than 20.5 2.0 means not less than 1.95 and not more than 2.05 0.20 means not less than 0.195 and not more than 0.205.

Establishment of limits Reasonable limits may be established using simple statistical methods, e.g. control chart techniques (1, 2). Analytical results from about 20 successive batches are pooled together, and the grand average and “three sigma limits” (±3 standard deviations from the grand average) are calculated. (Such calculations are applicable when more than one individual or independent sample per batch is analysed (3,4).) Solubility Unless otherwise specifi ed in the test procedure for the plant material concerned, the approximate solubility of medicinal plant materials should be determined at 20 °C. Solubility is expressed in terms of “parts”, representing the number of millilitres (ml) of the solvent, in which 1 g of the solid is soluble. Descriptive terms are sometimes used to indicate the solubility of a substance, with the following meanings: very soluble less than 1 part freely soluble 1–10 parts soluble 10–30 parts sparingly soluble 30–100 parts slightly soluble 100–1000 parts very slightly soluble 1000–10 000 parts practically insoluble more than 10 000 parts Storage Medicinal plant materials must be stored under specifi ed conditions in order to avoid contamination and deterioration. 42 Annex 2 Containers The container and its closure must not interact physically or chemically with the material within in any way that would alter its quality. The following descriptive terms are used to indicate general requirements for the permeability of containers: Well-closed containers must protect the contents from extraneous matter or from loss of the material under normal conditions of handling, shipment or storage. Tightly closed containers must protect the contents from extraneous matter, from loss of the material, and from effl orescence, deliquescence, or evaporation under normal conditions of handling, shipment or storage. If the container is intended to be opened on several occasions, it must be designed to be airtight after reclosure. Hermetically closed containers must protect the contents from extraneous matter and from loss of the substance, and be impervious to air or any other gas under normal conditions of handling, shipment or storage. In addition, a tamper-evident container is one that is fi tted with a device that reveals clearly whether it has ever been opened. Protection from light Medicinal plant materials requiring protection from light should be kept in a light- resistant container that – either by reason of the inherent properties of the material from which it is made or because a special coating has been applied to it – shields the contents from the effects of light. Alternatively, the container may be placed inside a suitable light-resistant (opaque) covering and/or stored in a dark place. Temperature Materials that need to be stored at temperatures other than room temperature (15 to 25 °C or, depending on the climate conditions, up to 30 °C) should be labelled accordingly. Humidity Low humidity may be maintained,", "page_start": 53, "page_end": 54, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

Care must be taken when the container is opened in damp or humid conditions. Size of cut Medicinal plant materials are used either whole, or in cut or powdered form. Cut medicinal plant materials are prepared by cutting or crushing the plant into small pieces. The cut is graded according to the aperture size of the mesh of the sieve through which the material will pass, and is indicated as follows: Aperture size (mm) coarse cut 4.00 medium cut 2.80 fi ne cut 2.00 43 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues Powder fi neness and sieve size Powders The coarseness or fi neness of a powder is classed according to the nominal aperture size expressed in micrometres of the mesh of the sieve through which the powder will pass, and is indicated as follows: Descriptive term Particle size Coarse (2000/355) All the particles will pass through a No. 2000 sieve, and not more than 40% through a No. 355 sieve Moderately coarse (710/250) All the particles will pass through a No. 710 sieve, and not more than 40% through a No. 250 sieve Moderately fi ne (355/180) All the particles will pass through a No. 355 sieve, and not more than 40% through a No. 180 sieve Fine (180) All the particles will pass through a No. 180 sieve Very fi ne (125) All the particles will pass through a No. 125 sieve Sieves The wire sieves used to sift powdered medicinal plant materials are classifi ed by numbers that indicate their nominal aperture size expressed in μm.

General recommendations for the sampling of pharmaceutical materials in connection with quality control are provided in the thirty-ninth report of the WHO Expert Committee on Specifi cations for Pharmaceutical Preparations (3). Because of the specifi c characteristics of medicinal plant materials, in particular their lack of homogeneity, special handling procedures are required in relation to sampling. The following procedures should be observed when selecting and preparing an average sample from a batch of material. Recommended procedures Sampling of material in bulk Inspect each container or packaging unit for conformity with pharmacopoeia monographs or other requirements regarding packaging and labelling. Check the condition of the package and note any defects that may infl uence the quality or stability of the contents (physical damage, moisture, etc.). Sample damaged containers individually. If initial inspection indicates that the batch is uniform, take samples as follows. When a batch consists of fi ve containers or packaging units, take a sample from each one. From a batch of 6–50 units, take a sample from fi ve. In the case of batches of over 50 units, sample 10%, rounding up the number of units to the nearest multiple of ten. For example, a batch of 51 units would be sampled as for 60, i.e. take samples from six packages. After opening, inspect the contents of the units selected for sampling for: - organoleptic characteristics (colour, texture and odour); - presentation of the material (raw, cut, crushed, compressed); - the presence of admixtures, foreign matter (sand, glass particles, dirt), mould or signs of decay; - the presence of insects; - the presence of packaging material originating from poor or degraded containers. From each container or package selected, take three original samples, taking care to avoid fragmentation. Samples should be taken from the top, middle and bottom of the container. In the case of sacks and packages, the three samples should be taken by hand, the fi rst from a depth of not less than 10 cm from the top and the second and third from the middle and bottom after cutting into the side of the package. Samples of seeds should be withdrawn with a grain probe. Material in boxes should fi rst be sampled from the upper layer; then approximately half of the contents", "page_start": 55, "page_end": 56, "source": "WHO", "document": "9789241594448_eng.pdf"}

In the case of sacks and packages, the three samples should be taken by hand, the fi rst from a depth of not less than 10 cm from the top and the second and third from the middle and bottom after cutting into the side of the package. Samples of seeds should be withdrawn with a grain probe. Material in boxes should fi rst be sampled from the upper layer; then approximately half of the contents should be removed and a second sample taken. Finally after further removal of material, another sample should be taken from the bottom. Samples should be as uniform as possible in mass. The three original samples should then be combined into a pooled sample which should be mixed carefully. 45 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues The average sample is obtained by quartering. Form the pooled sample, adequately mixed, into an even and square-shaped heap, and divide it diagonally into four equal parts. Take two diagonally opposite parts and mix carefully. Repeat the process as necessary until the required quantity, to within ± 10%, is obtained (100– 200 g for fl owers and up to 10 kg for certain roots). Any remaining material should be returned to the batch. Using the same quartering procedure, divide the average sample into four fi nal samples, taking care that each portion is representative of the bulk material. The fi nal samples are tested for the following characteristics: - degree of fragmentation (sieve test); - identity and level of impurities; - moisture and ash content; - level of active ingredients, where possible. A portion of each fi nal sample should be retained to serve as reference material, which may also be used for re-test purposes, if necessary. Sampling of material in retail packages From each wholesale container (boxes, cartons, etc.) selected for sampling, take at random two consumer packages. From small batches (1–5 boxes), take ten consumer packages. Prepare the pooled sample by mixing the contents of the selected consumer packages and proceed as described above to obtain the fi nal sample. References 1. Quality control methods.

Limit tests A.1 Limit test for arsenic Arsenic is abundant in nature and its presence in herbal medicines should be no different to its wide occurrence in foods. A popular test method relies on the digestion of the plant matrix followed by subjection of the digestate to a comparative colorimetric test in a special apparatus. The test method described below uses colorimetry and does not use toxic mercuric bromide paper. The method uses N-N-diethylmethyldithiocarbamate in pyridine and it reacts with hydrogen arsenide to afford a red–purple complex. The limit is expressed in terms of arsenic (III) trioxide (As O ). 2 3 Apparatus Use the apparatus illustrated in Fig. A3.1.

Determination of specifi c toxic metals Atomic absorption spectrometry (AA) is used for the determination of the amount or concentration of specifi c heavy metals. AA uses the phenomenon that atoms in the ground state absorb light of a specifi c wavelength, characteristic of the particular atom, when the light passes through an atomic vapour layer of the element to be determined. Caution must be exercised when using the recommended closed high-pressure digestion vessels and microwave laboratory equipment, and the operators should be fully familiar with the safety and operating instructions given by the manufacturer.

Usually a maximum permitted level is set for certain products, but when the TVC exceeds this level then it is unnecessary to proceed with determination of specifi c organisms; the material should be rejected without being subjected to further testing. A.1 Pretreatment of the test herbal material Depending on the nature of the crude medicinal plant material, grind, dissolve, dilute, suspend or emulsify it using a suitable method and eliminate any antimicrobial properties by dilution, neutralization or fi ltration. Either phosphate buffer pH 7.2; buffered sodium chloride-peptone solution, pH 7.0; or fl uid medium, used for the test, is used to suspend or dilute the test specimen. Some materials have special requirements, which have to be met for acceptable pretreatment to be performed. Some examples are as follows: 59 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues A.1.1 Materials containing tannins, antimicrobial substances Some herbal preparations present diffi culties in determining levels of microbes, e.g. those containing high contents of tannins or essential oils. When test specimens have antimicrobial activity or contain antimicrobial substances, any such antimicrobial properties are removed as mentioned above. For the test, use a mixture of several portions selected at random from the bulk or from the contents of a suffi cient number of containers. If the test specimens are diluted with fl uid medium, the test should be performed quickly. A.1.2 Water-soluble materials Dissolve or dilute 10 g or 10 ml of plant material, unless otherwise specifi ed in the test procedure for the material concerned, in lactose broth or another suitable medium proven to have no antimicrobial activity under the conditions of the test. Adjust the volume to 100 ml with the same medium. (Note that some materials may require the use of larger volumes.) If necessary, adjust the pH of the suspension to about 7.

Mix carefully while maintaining the temperature in a water-bath or oven. Add 85 ml of lactose broth or another suitable medium proven to have no antimicrobial activity under the conditions of the test, if necessary heated to a temperature not exceeding 40 °C. Maintain this temperature for the shortest time necessary until an emulsion is formed and, in any case, for not more than 30 minutes. If necessary, adjust the pH of the emulsion to about 7. A.2 Test procedures Plate count For bacteria use Petri dishes 9–10 cm in diameter. To one dish add a mixture of 1 ml of the pre-treated plant material and about 15 ml of liquefi ed casein-soybean digest agar at a temperature not exceeding 45 °C. Alternatively, spread the material on the surface of the solidifi ed medium in a Petri dish. If necessary, dilute the material to obtain an expected colony count of not more than 300. Prepare at least two dishes using the same dilution, invert them and incubate them at 30–35 °C for 48–72 hours, unless a more reliable count is obtained in a shorter period of time. Count the number of colonies formed and calculate the results using the plate with the largest number of colonies, up to a maximum of 300. 60 Annex 5 For fungi use Petri dishes 9–10 cm in diameter. To one dish add a mixture of 1 ml of the pretreated material and about 15 ml of liquefi ed Sabouraud glucose agar with antibiotics (also used is potato dextrose agar with antibiotics) at a temperature not exceeding 45 °C. Alternatively, spread the pretreated material on the surface of the solidifi ed medium in a Petri dish. If necessary, dilute the material as described above to obtain an expected colony count of not more than 100.

Membrane fi ltration Use membrane fi lters with a nominal pore size of not greater than 0.45 μm, and with a proven effectiveness at retaining bacteria, e.g. cellulose nitrate fi lters are used for aqueous, oily and weakly alcoholic solutions, whereas cellulose acetate fi lters are better for strongly alcoholic solutions. The technique below uses fi lter discs of about 50 mm in diameter. Where fi lters of a different diameter are used, adjust the volumes of the dilutions and washings accordingly. Sterilize, by appropriate means, the fi ltration apparatus and the membrane, as the solution is introduced, fi ltered and examined under aseptic conditions, and the membrane is then transferred to the culture medium. The detailed method Transfer 10 ml or a solution containing 1g of the material to each of two membrane fi lter apparatuses and fi lter immediately. If necessary, dilute the pretreated material to obtain an expected colony count of 10–100. Wash each membrane, fi ltering three or more successive quantities of approximately 100 ml of a suitable liquid such as buffered sodium chloride-peptone solution at pH 7.0. For fatty materials, a suitable surfactant may be added, such as Polysorbate 20 R or 80 R. Transfer one of the membrane fi lters, intended primarily for the enumeration of bacteria, to the surface of a plate with soybean-casein digest agar and the other, intended primarily for the enumeration of fungi, to the surface of a plate with Sabouraud glucose agar with antibiotics. Incubate the plates for 5 days, unless a more reliable count can be obtained otherwise, at 30–35 °C for the detection of bacteria and at 20–25 °C for the detection of fungi. Count the number of colonies formed. Calculate the number of microorganisms per gram or per ml of the material tested, if necessary counting bacteria and fungi separately. Serial dilution Prepare a series of 12 tubes each containing 9–10 ml of soybean-casein digest medium.

Growth- promoting qualities are tested by inoculating 1 ml of each microorganism into each medium. The test media are satisfactory if clear evidence of growth appears in all the inoculated media after incubation at the indicated temperature for 5 days. When a count of test organisms with a test specimen is less than one-fi fth of that without the test specimen, any such effect must be eliminated by dilution, fi ltration, neutralization or inactivation. To confi rm the sterility of the medium and of the diluent and the aseptic performance of the test, follow the TVC method using sterile buffered sodium chloride-peptone solution, pH 7.0, or phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, as a control. There should be no growth of microorganisms. To validate the method, a count for the test organism should be obtained differing by not more than a factor of 10 from the calculated value for the inoculum. B. Tests for specifi c microorganisms Microbial tests should be applied to starting plant materials, intermediate and fi nished products where necessary. Enterobacteria and certain other Gram-negative bacteriaEscherichia coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus are included as target strains of the test. The conditions of the tests for microbial contamination are designed to minimize accidental contamination of the materials being examined and the precautions taken must not adversely affect any microorganisms that could be revealed. B.1 Pretreatment of the material being examined Refer to the sampling and preparation of the test solution in TVC (see section A.2), including the elimination of any antimicrobial substances which may be present. B.2 Test procedure for the Enterobacteriaceae and certain other Gram-negative bacteria Detection of bacteria Homogenize the pretreated material appropriately and incubate at 30–37 °C for a length of time suffi cient for revivifi cation of the bacteria, but not suffi cient for multiplication of the organisms (usually 2–5 hours). Shake the container, transfer aliquots equivalent to 1 g or 1 ml of the homogenized material to 100 ml of Enterobacteriaceae enrichment broth Mossel and incubate at 35–37 °C for 18–48 hours.

Prepare a subculture on a plate with MacConkey agar and incubate at 43–45 °C for 18–24 hours. Growth of red, generally non-mucoid colonies of Gram-negative rods, sometimes surrounded by a reddish zone of precipitation, indicates the possible presence of E. coli. This may be confi rmed by the formation of indole at 43.5–44.5 °C or by other biochemical reactions. The material passes the test if no such colonies are detected or if the confi rmatory biochemical reactions are negative. Salmonella spp. Incubate the solution, suspension or emulsion of the pretreated material prepared as described above at 35–37 °C for 5–24 hours, as appropriate for enrichment. Primary test Transfer 10 ml of the enrichment culture to 100 ml of tetrathionate bile brilliant green broth and incubate at 42–43 °C for 18–24 hours.

If no growth of microorganisms is detected, the material passes the test. If growth of colonies of Gram-negative rods occurs, usually with a greenish fl uorescence, apply an oxidase test and test the growth in soybean-casein digest medium at 42 °C.

Direct inoculation of agar plates Use 2 or 3 loopfuls of the herbal materials, preparations or products to be tested. Incubate plates at 35–37 °C for 18–24 hours. Inoculate a general purpose plating medium of low selectivity and one of moderate or high selectivity. MacConkeyagar is recommended as a medium of low selectivity. MacConkey agar with 1 mcg/ml of potassium tellurite has been reported to be particularly useful for S. dysenteriae type 1 (Sd1). Use a small inoculum. Incubate at 35–37 °C for 18–24 hours. 66 Annex 5 Xylose-lysine-desoxycholate (XLD) agar is recommended as a medium of moderate or high selectivity for isolation of Shigella. Desoxycholate citrate agar (DCA) is a suitable alternative. Note: Do not use salmonella–shigella (SS) agar, as it often inhibits growth of Sd1. Each new batch of medium should be controlled for quality before routine use by inoculating it with known reference strains and observing their growth and colony characteristics. Identifi cation of colonies on plating media Colonies suspicious for Shigella will appear as follows: - MacConkey agar: convex, colourless, 2–3 mm - XLD agar: red, smooth, 1–2 mm - DCA agar: colourless, translucent, 2–3 mm Identify well-separated colonies of typical appearance to be transferred from each of the plating media for further testing by making a mark on the bottom of the Petri dish. Whenever possible a person experienced in the identifi cation of Shigella should train laboratory workers who are unfamiliar with its identifi cation. Inoculation of Kligler iron agar Pick three characteristic colonies from the plating media and inoculate into Kligler iron agar (KIA) as follows: stab the butt and then streak the slant with a zigzag confi guration. Pay attention to proper labelling of the tubes. If screw-cap KIA tubes are used, make sure that the caps are loose. Incubate overnight. On the following morning, examine the reactions in the KIA tubes. Tubes suspicious for Shigella will have an acid (yellow) butt and an alkaline (red) slant. They will not produce gas (no bubbles or cracks in the agar) and will not produce hydrogen sulfi de (no black along the stab line). Triple sugar iron agar (TSI) can also be used for the identifi cation of Shigella. It will give the same reactions as KIA.

These methods may be coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). Samples are extracted by a standard procedure, impurities are removed by partition and/or adsorption, and the presence of a moderately broad spectrum of pesticides is measured in a single determination. However, these techniques are not universally applicable. Some pesticides are satisfactorily carried through the extraction and clean-up procedures, others are recovered with a poor yield, and some are lost entirely.

Some pesticides are satisfactorily carried through the extraction and clean-up procedures, others are recovered with a poor yield, and some are lost entirely. Following chromatography, the separations may not always be complete, pesticides may decompose or metabolize, and many of the metabolic products are still unknown. Consequently, as a result of limitations in the analytical technique and incomplete knowledge of pesticide interactions with the environment, it is not yet possible to apply an integrated set of methods that will be satisfactory in all situations. Generally the methodology should be adapted to the type of herbal material being tested and modifi cations may be necessary for different samples including seeds, leaves, oils, extracts, fi nished products and for samples containing different quantities of moisture. Also the spectrum of pesticides to be tested for is dependent on the specifi c pesticides used on the plant material and the history of use of persistent pesticides in the region. It is, therefore, desirable to test plant materials of unknown history for broad groups of compounds rather than for individual pesticides. A variety of methods are suitable for this purpose. Pesticides containing chlorine in the molecule, for 69 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues example, can be detected by the measurement of total organic chlorine; insecticides containing phosphate can be measured by analysis for total organic phosphorus, whereas pesticides containing arsenic and lead can be detected by measurement of total arsenic or total lead, respectively. Similarly, the measurement of total bound carbon disulfi de in a sample will provide information on whether residues of the dithiocarbamate family of fungicides are present. Importantly, where such general methods are employed, care must be taken to ensure that results are not adversely affected by contributions from certain plant constituents containing the targeted elements. If the pesticide to which the plant material has been exposed is known or can be identifi ed by suitable means, an established method for the determination of that particular pesticide residue should be employed. General aspects of analytical methodology The samples should be tested as quickly as possible after collection, before any physical or chemical changes occur. If prolonged storage is envisaged, the samples should preferably be stored in airtight containers under refrigeration. The water content of samples can also be problematic and in some offi cial pharmacopoeias, content is limited to 15% and below for the determination of organochlorine and pyrethroid insecticides. Light can cause degradation of many pesticides, and it is therefore advisable to protect the samples and any extracts or solutions from undue exposure to light. The type of container or wrapping material used should not interfere with the sample or affect the analytical results. Solvents and reagents used in the analytical method should be free from substances that may interfere with the reaction, alter the results or provoke degradation of the pesticide residue in the sample.

The type of container or wrapping material used should not interfere with the sample or affect the analytical results. Solvents and reagents used in the analytical method should be free from substances that may interfere with the reaction, alter the results or provoke degradation of the pesticide residue in the sample. It is usually necessary to employ specially purifi ed solvents or to distil them freshly in an all-glass apparatus. Blank determinations with the solvents should be carried out, concentrating and testing them as specifi ed in the test procedure for the plant material concerned. The simplest and quickest procedure should be used to separate unwanted material from the sample (clean-up procedure) in order to save time when many samples have to be tested. The process of concentrating solutions should be undertaken with great care, especially during the evaporation of the last traces of solvent, to avoid losses of pesticide residues. For this reason, it is often not advisable to remove the last traces of solvent. Agents, such as mineral oil or other oils of low volatility that may help to preserve the solution could be added to retard the loss of the relatively volatile pesticides, especially when the last traces of solvent are being evaporated. However, these agents, while satisfactory in colorimetric procedures, are usually not desirable in gas chromatographic methods. It may be necessary to evaporate heat-labile compounds using a rotary vacuum apparatus. 70 Annex 6 1. Determination of total chlorine and phosphorus Most pesticides contain organically bound chlorine or phosphorus. Procedure Preparation of samples Reduce the plant material to a fi ne powder, and extract with a mixture of water and acetonitrile R. Most pesticides are soluble in this mixture, while most cellular constituents (e.g. cellulose, proteins, amino acids, starch, fats and related compounds) are sparingly soluble and are thus removed. A number of polar and moderately polar compounds may also be dissolved; it is therefore necessary to transfer the pesticides to light petroleum R. For pesticides containing chlorine, further purifi cation is seldom required, but for those containing phosphorus, further purifi cation by column chromatography may be necessary, eluting with mixtures of light petroleum R and ether R. Preparation of the column Use Florisil R grade 60/100 PR (or equivalent), activated at 650 °C, as the support. If this material is obtained in bulk, transfer it immediately after opening to a 500-ml glass jar or bottle with a glass stopper or foil-lined, screw-top lid. Store in the dark. Before use, heat at not less than 130 °C, cool in a desiccator to room temperature and heat once again to 130 °C after 2 days.

Place 20–50 g of the ground sample into a blender, add 350 ml of acetonitrile R with a water content of 35% (to 350 ml of water add suffi cient acetonitrile R to produce 1000 ml). Blend for 5 minutes at a high speed. Filter under vacuum through an appropriate funnel, diameter 12 cm, fi tted with fi lter paper, into a 500-ml suction fl ask. Transfer the fi ltrate to a 250-ml measuring cylinder and record the volume. Transfer the measured fi ltrate to a 1-litre separating funnel and carefully add 100 ml of light petroleum R.

Combustion of the organic matter Combustion of the organic matter in oxygen is the preparatory step for the determination of chlorine and phosphorus. The pesticide is extracted from the sample and purifi ed if necessary. The extract is concentrated, evaporated to dryness, transferred to a sample holder, and burned in a suitable conical fl ask fl ushed with oxygen. The gases produced during combustion are then absorbed in a suitable solution. The absorbed chlorine is determined as chloride and the absorbed phosphorus as orthophosphate, both using colorimetry. Apparatus The combustion is carried out in a 1-litre conical fl ask made of borosilicate glass, into the stopper of which is fused one end of a piece of platinum wire about 1 mm in diameter. To the free end of the wire is attached a piece of platinum gauze measuring about 1.5 × 2 cm to provide a means of holding the sample clear of the absorbing liquid during combustion. Sample holder for chlorine-containing residues For a small quantity of solid material, use a sample holder made from a piece of halide-free fi lter-paper about 5 cm long and 3 cm wide; for a small volume of liquid, it is preferable to use a sample holder in the form of a cone made from cellulose acetate fi lm. Prepare the cone as follows: wearing cloth gloves and using a suitable cardboard template, cut from the fi lm a circle of radius 4 cm. Manually pin the two edges together to form a cone. Seal the joined edges using heat to form a seam about 5 mm wide. Immerse the seam in acetone R to about one half of its width for 10 seconds. Remove and dry it immediately in a stream of hot air. Using forceps, wash the cone by dipping in a 1-litre beaker containing warm sodium hydroxide (~240 g/l) TS for 10 seconds at a temperature of about 60 °C. Rinse the cone thoroughly with water and allow to drain dry on a piece of aluminium foil. Place each cone in a clean funnel (diameter 65 mm).

Wearing rubber gloves, remove the sample holder and its dry contents from the funnel, and fold it over and up to form a small packet, about 1 cm2 in area, and secure it in the centre of the platinum gauze. Insert a narrow strip of fi lter 72 Annex 6 paper, about 1 × 3 cm, as a fuse into the top of the holder, between the folds of the packet. Add 30 ml of water to the combustion fl ask. Moisten the neck of the fl ask with water. Fill the fl ask thoroughly with oxygen by means of a tube with its end just above the liquid. Ignite the free end of the paper strip and immediately insert the stopper. Hold the stopper fi rmly in place. When vigorous burning has begun, tilt the fl ask to prevent incompletely burned material from falling into the liquid. Immediately after combustion is completed, shake the fl ask vigorously for 10 minutes to dissolve the combustion products. Place a small quantity of water around the rim of the fl ask, and carefully withdraw the stopper. Rinse the stopper, platinum wire, platinum gauze and sides of the fl ask with water. Transfer the liquid and liquids used for rinsing to a 50-ml volumetric fl ask and dilute to volume with water.

The reading should be made promptly to minimize absorption of chloride from the air. Prepare a standard solution of sodium chloride R containing 5 μg of chloride per ml. Transfer aliquots of this solution (0 ml, 2 ml, 4 ml, 6 ml, 8 ml and 10 ml) into a series of 50-ml conical fl asks and dilute to 15 ml with water. Develop the colour and measure the absorbances as described above. Plot the absorbances against the chloride content of the dilutions in μg per ml and interpolate the chloride content of the solutions of the material tested. 3. Determination of phosphates The phosphomolybdate method is based on the reaction of phosphate ions with ammonium molybdate to form a molybdophosphate complex, which is subsequently reduced to form a strongly blue-coloured molybdenum complex. 73 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues The intensity of the blue colour is measured spectrophotometrically. This method is applicable for the determination of any phosphates that have undergone a prior separation procedure. Naturally occurring phosphates are present in most samples, and are often not removed during the clean-up procedure. In order to obtain background values, therefore, it is necessary to proceed with the determination for all samples, even those with no phosphate-containing pesticides. These background values should be subtracted from the results obtained on testing pesticide residues. Extracts of most uncontaminated materials contain about 0.05–0.1 mg/kg of phosphorus. Therefore, no contamination with organophosphate pesticides can be assumed for results in this range. Apparatus The determination is made with a spectrophotometer capable of measuring absorbance at 820 nm using an absorption cell with a path-length of 1 cm. Method Place 7 ml of the solution obtained after combustion in a calibrated 10-ml test- tube. Add 2.2 ml of sulfuric acid (300 g/l) TS and mix the solution well. Add 0.4 ml of ammonium molybdate (40 g/l) TS and swirl the mixture. Then add 0.4 ml of aminonaphtholsulfonic acid TS and swirl again.

Qualitative and quantitative determination of organochlorine pesticides Preparation of sample Place 20 g of powdered plant material (sieve no. 180), accurately weighed, in a 500-ml beaker (tall form), mix with 98 ml of water and allow to macerate for at least 30 minutes. Add 200 ml of acetone R; the resulting volume of extraction solvent will be 295 ml. Extract for 5 minutes, while cooling, using a high-speed mixer. Filter the homogenized mixture through a porcelain fi lter (Büchner funnel, diameter 70 mm) fi tted with a fi lter paper, using a slight vacuum, into a 250-ml graduated cylinder, allowing the process to last no longer than 1 minute, and then measure the volume (V)of the fi ltrate in ml. Method Transfer the fi ltrate prepared as above to a 500-ml separating funnel. Add a quantity ofsodium chloride R equivalent in grams to one-tenth of the volume of the fi ltrate, then add 100 ml of dichloromethane R. Shake vigorously for 5 minutes, allow the phases to separate and discard the lower (aqueous) layer. Dry the acetone-dichloromethane phase, transfer it to a 500-ml conical fl ask, add 25 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate R and swirl occasionally. Next, fi lter the solution into a 500-ml fl ask with a ground-glass 74 Annex 6 stopper using a glass funnel (diameter 100 mm) containing purifi ed glass-wool and anhydrous sodium sulfate R.

Analysis of esters of organophosphorus compounds Although most organophosphorus compounds undergo rapid decomposition, Member States may elect to test for them because of their harmful nature if present in signifi cant concentrations. Testing may be more relevant in the case of herbal medicines used at high concentrations and frequency. The extraction and the clean-up procedures can be performed as described above, but the detection requires a phosphorus fl ame ionization detector (P-FID). 6. Determination of specifi c pesticide residues in medicinal plant material General recommendations For the total determination, mix thoroughly 1 kg of plant material. In order to obtain reliable chromatographic results, do one or more of the following: - repeat the separation using another column; - use a different separation system; - use a different detector system; - apply a coupling technique; - prepare a derivative; - perform chromatography with a mixture of the sample and a reference substance; - change the sample preparation; - use a fractionated elution during the column-chromatography clean-up procedure of the plant extract and test every fraction by chromatography; and - compare the distribution coeffi cient of the material with that of a reference substance. Prior to the quantitative determination of the material to be tested, check whether there is a linear relationship between the values obtained for the reference substance and its concentration over the range 0.1–2 times the standard concentration. Otherwise, prepare another concentration range or evaluate the results using a reference curve. Use any suitable mechanical or manual technique for the chromatographic determination. 77 WHO guidelines for assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues Store the reference solutions protected from light to prevent decomposition.

Determination of specifi c organochlorine, organophosphorus and pyrethroid insecticide residues Depending on the substance being examined, it may be necessary to modify, sometimes extensively, the procedure described below. In any case, it may be necessary to use, in addition, another column with a different polarity or another detection method (e.g. mass spectrometry) or a different method (e.g. immunochemical method) to confi rm the results obtained. This procedure is valid only for the analysis of samples of medicinal plant materials containing less than 15% water. Samples with a higher content of water may be dried, provided it has been shown that the drying procedure does not signifi cantly affect the pesticide content.

Abbreviations 2. Executive summary 2.1 Guideline translations 3. Introduction 4. Prevention 4.1 Vector control 4.1.1 Interventions recommended for large-scale deployment Strong recommendation for , High certainty evidence Pyrethroid-only nets (2019) Pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults living in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. Remark: - WHO recommends ITNs that have beenprequalifiedby WHO for deployment in protecting populations at risk of malaria. - ITNs are most effective where the principal malaria vector(s) bite predominantly at night after people have retired under their nets. - ITNs can be used both indoors and outdoors, wherever they can be suitably hung (though hanging nets in direct sunlight should be avoided, as sunlight can affect insecticidal activity). Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (2022) Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs can be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission where the principal malaria vector(s) exhibit pyrethroid resistance. Remark: The conditionality of this recommendation is driven by the current higher unit cost of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs and therefore the uncertainty of their affordability in different settings. Furthermore, asPBO is less wash- resistant than pyrethroids, its bioavailability declines faster over the three-year estimated life of an ITN; therefore, the added impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over that of pyrethroid-only LLINs may decline over time. The evidence comes from two sites in eastern Africa with pyrethroid resistance and not from other geographies where transmission levels and vector characteristics may vary. PBO acts by inhibiting certain metabolic enzymes, primarily oxidases, and so are likely to provide greater protection than pyrethroid-only LLINs where mosquitoes display mono-oxygenase-based insecticide resistance mechanisms. In deciding whether pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may be appropriate in their context, malaria programmes should: - consider the deployment of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in areas where resistance to pyrethroids in local vectors has been detected; - determine", "page_start": 4, "page_end": 5, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Strong recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs vs pyrethroid-only LLINs (2023) 5 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs should be deployed instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance. Remark: Note: Recommendations on deployment of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets were separated into two distinct recommendations for better clarity, but share the same evidence to decision, justification, practical info and research needs. Please refer to the following section. Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs vs pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (2023) Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs can be deployed instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance. Remark: The conditionality of the recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of desirable and undesirable effects probably favours pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs over pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. However, the evidence for this recommendation is from only one trial in Africa. In deciding whether to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, malaria programmes should: - determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra costs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, while ensuring optimal coverage of populations at risk of malaria; - generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g. stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as pyrethroid resistance mechanisms).

Remark: The conditionality of the recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs is based on the GDG’s concerns that the available evidence indicates poor cost-effectiveness of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs.

Conditional recommendation against , Moderate certainty evidence Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs vs pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (2023) 6 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs are not recommended for deployment over pyrethroid-PBO ITNs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance. Remark: The conditionality of the recommendationagainstthe deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of effects favours pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs and that, based on current cost and efficacy data, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs are more cost-effective. The GDG acknowledged that evidence to support this recommendation is derived from only a single trial in Africa. Strong recommendation for , High certainty evidence Insecticide-treated nets: Humanitarian emergency setting (2022) Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by a humanitarian emergency. Remark: This recommendation is limited to classes of ITNs currently recommended by WHO. As with ITNs deployed in more stable settings, WHO recommends that ITNs that areprequalifiedby WHO be selected for use in humanitarian emergencies. When considering deployment of ITNs in humanitarian emergencies, the infrastructure, access, logistical capacity and resources available must be taken into account, as these may influence the feasibility and cost of procuring and deploying nets. Practice Statement Achieving and maintaining optimal coverage with ITNs for malaria prevention and control (2019) To achieve and maintain optimal ITN coverage, countries should apply mass free net distribution through campaigns, combined with other locally appropriate delivery mechanisms such as continuous distribution using antenatal care (ANC) clinics and the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI).

Practice Statement Achieving and maintaining optimal coverage with ITNs for malaria prevention and control (2019) To achieve and maintain optimal ITN coverage, countries should apply mass free net distribution through campaigns, combined with other locally appropriate delivery mechanisms such as continuous distribution using antenatal care (ANC) clinics and the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Recipients of ITNs should be advised (through appropriate communicationstrategies) to continue using their nets, irrespective of the condition and age of the net, until a replacement net is available. Practice Statement Management of old ITNs (2019) Old ITNs should only be collected where there is assurance that: i) communities are not left without nets, i.e. new ITNs are distributed to replace old ones; and ii) there is a suitable and sustainable plan in place for safe disposal of the collected material. If ITNs and their packaging (bags and baling materials) are collected, the best option for disposal is high-temperature incineration. They should not be burned in the open air. In the absence of appropriate facilities, they should be buried away from water sources and preferably in non-permeable soil. Recipients of ITNs should be advised (through appropriate communication strategies) not to dispose of their nets in any water body, as the residual insecticide on the net can be toxic to aquatic organisms (especially fish). Strong recommendation for , Very low certainty evidence Updated Indoor residual spraying (2025) IRS should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults living in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. Remark: WHO recommends that products from the insecticide classes indicated below be used for IRS. Selection of the product should be made from the WHO list ofprequalified products, and with due consideration of the insecticide susceptibility of the local malaria vector(s). 7 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) IRS is considered to be an appropriate intervention where: - the majority of the vector population feeds and rests indoors; - people mainly sleep indoors at night; - the malaria transmission pattern is such that the population can be protected by one or two rounds of IRS per year; and - the majority of structures are suitable for spraying. Conditional recommendation for , Very low certainty evidence Indoor residual spraying: Humanitarian emergency setting (2022) IRS can be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by a humanitarian emergency. Remark: The conditionality of this recommendation is largely driven by the very low certainty of the evidence that IRS reduces malaria in such settings and due to concerns around feasibility and cost.

When deciding whether IRS may be appropriate for prevention and control of malaria in humanitarian emergency settings, programmes should consider: - whether the structures are suitable for spraying. Some shelters provided in emergency settings may not be suitable for application of insecticides, such as open-sided structures and those built from materials that affect the residual nature of the insecticides; - whether the target coverage of IRS can be feasibly achieved in the setting; - whether there are sufficient resources to cover the relatively high costs associated with an IRS programme. In such settings, transport of commodities to hard-to-reach areas, coupled with the need to quickly procure items and establish human capacity to deliver the intervention, is likely to incur higher costs than when deploying IRS in more stable settings. As with the deployment of IRS in more stable settings, WHO recommends that products from insecticide classes indicated under the WHO recommendation, and that have beenWHO-prequalifiedbe selected for IRS use in humanitarian emergencies. It is important to ensure that the vector population is susceptible to the insecticide selected for spraying. 4.1.2 Co-deploying ITNs and IRS Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Prioritize optimal coverage with either ITNs or IRS over combination (2019) The co-deployment of ITNs and IRS is not recommended for prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. Priority should be given to delivering either ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage and to a high standard, rather than introducing the second intervention as a means to compensate for deficiencies in the implementation of the first intervention. Remark: In settings where optimal ITN coverage, as specified in the strategic plan, has been achieved and where ITNs remain effective, additionally implementing IRS may have limited utility in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. Given the resource constraints across malaria endemic countries, it is recommended that effort be focused on good-quality implementation of either ITNs or IRS, rather than deploying both in the same area. However, the combination of these interventions may be considered for resistance prevention, mitigation or management should sufficient resources be available. Practice Statement Access to ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage levels (2019) Access to effective vector control using ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage levels should be ensured forall populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings. Practice Statement 8 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) No scale-back in areas with ongoing local malaria transmission (2019) In areas with ongoing local malaria transmission (irrespective of both the pre-interventionand current level of transmission), vector control interventions should not be scaled back.

Ensuring access to effective malaria vector control at optimal levels for allinhabitants of such areas should be pursued and maintained. 4.1.3 Supplementary interventions Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Larviciding (2019) Insecticides can be regularly applied to water bodies (larviciding) for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults as a supplementary intervention to ITNs or IRS in areas with ongoing malaria transmission where aquatic habitats are few, fixed and findable. Remark: The conditionality of this recommendation is due to the low certainty of evidence, the impact being limited to non-extensive habitats, and concerns about feasibility. When considering larviciding, programmes should note the following: - Larviciding only reduces vector density and so does not have the same potential for health impact as ITNs and IRS; ITNs provide protection from biting vectors and both ITNs and IRS reduce adult longevity. - Larviciding should not be seen as a substitute for ITNs or IRS or a means to fill a coverage gap in areas with significant malaria risk; rather, larviciding represents a potential supplementary strategy for malaria control. - Feasibility and cost-effectiveness should be taken into account; larviciding will generally be most cost-effective in areas where larval habitats are few, fixed and findable, and likely less feasible in areas where the aquatic habitats are abundant, scattered and variable. The following settings are potentially the most suitable for larviciding as a supplementary measure implemented alongside ITNs or IRS: - urban areas, where breeding sites are relatively few, fixed and findable in relation to houses (which are targeted for ITNs or IRS); and - arid regions, where larval habitats may be few and fixed throughout much of the year. Larval habitat modification and/or larval habitat manipulation (2021) No recommendation can be made because the evidence on the effectiveness of a specific larval habitat modification and/or larval habitat manipulation intervention for the prevention and control of malaria was deemed to be insufficient. Larvivorous fish (2019) No recommendation can be made because no evidence on the effectiveness of larvivorous fish for the prevention and control of malaria was identified. Conditional recommendation against , Low certainty evidence Topical repellents (2023) The deployment of topical repellents in areas with ongoing malaria transmission is not recommended if the aim is to prevent and control malaria at the community level. Remark: The panel recommended against the implementation of topical repellents if the main aim is to control malaria at the community level, given the lack of evidence of significant impact.

The panel noted that topical repellents may, however, offer protection for individuals and for high- risk groups who do not benefit from other vector control interventions; however, studies demonstrating impact against malaria at the individual level or in specific risk groups are required to support a formal recommendation. Conditional recommendation against , Low certainty evidence Insecticide-treated clothing (2019) 9 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Deployment of insecticide-treated clothing is not recommended for the prevention and control of malaria at the community level in areas with ongoing malaria transmission; however, insecticide-treated clothing may be beneficial as an intervention to provide personal protection against malaria in specific population groups. Remark: The GDG recommended against the deployment of insecticide-treated clothing due to the lack of evidence of an impact in the general population.In the absence of ITNs, there is some evidence that insecticide‐treated clothing may reduce the risk of malaria infection in specific populations such as refugees and military personnel. Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence New Spatial emanators (2025) Spatial emanatorscan be deployedfor the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. Remark: The conditionality of the recommendation to deploy spatial repellents is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of desirable and undesirable effects probably favours deployment alongside ITNs or IRS, but considers that the systematic review found considerable heterogeneity in protective effect, largely explained by different levels of coverage achieved with the spatial repellent in each trial. The GDG therefore noted that effective protection of the population with spatial repellents depends on continuous high coverage in the target area, with duration of efficacy of the product and distribution model being the key determinants of feasibility and cost-effectiveness. In deciding whether to deploy spatial emanators as a supplementary intervention, malaria programmes should: - ensure that targeted coverage levels of interventions recommended for large-scale deployment (ITNs, IRS) are achieved and sustained; - determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra costs, especially given the residual efficacy of the specific spatial repellent product under consideration; - generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g. stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as local vector susceptibility to the active ingredient); - note that only indoor use of spatial emanators has been assessed in the development of this recommendation, and therefore the recommendation only covers the indoor use of spatial emanators at this time; and - note that WHO recommends selecting spatial emanators that are prequalified by WHO for deployment.

Conditional recommendation against , Very low certainty evidence Space spraying (2019) Space sprayingis not recommended for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission; IRS or ITNs should be prioritized instead. Remark: The panel recommended against the deployment of space spraying to control malaria, given the lack of evidence of impact against malaria. Due to the short-lived nature of the insecticides used, space spraying is generally costly and wasteful of resources. Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence House screening (2021) Screening of residential houses can be used for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. Remark: 10 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) The GDG determined that a conditional recommendation should be given for house screening because of the low- to moderate- certainty evidence of an impact against malaria. Furthermore, programmes would need to consider a number of local contextual factors when consideringscreening of residential houses as a public health strategy, such as: - how the intervention will be delivered and maintained; - whether the structure and condition of the residential houses in the community allow for the installation of screening; - the feasibility and resources needed for implementation, especially if deployed on a large scale. Programmes should note that this recommendation addresses the use of screening of windows, ceilings, doors and/or eave spaces, and does not cover other ways of blocking entry points into houses. 4.1.4 Research needs 4.2 Preventive chemotherapies 4.2.1 Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) Strong recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (2022) In malaria-endemic areas, pregnant women of all gravidities should be given antimalarial medicine at predetermined intervals to reduce disease burden in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Remark: - Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been widely used for malaria chemoprevention during pregnancy and remains effective in improving key pregnancy outcomes. - IPTp-SP should start as early as possible in the second trimester and not before week 13 of pregnancy. - Doses should be given at least one month apart, with the objective of ensuring that at least three doses are received. - Antenatal care (ANC) contacts remain an important platform for delivering IPTp.

Remark: - Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) schedules should be informed by the age pattern of severe malaria admissions, the duration of protection of the selected drug, and the feasibility and affordability of delivering each additional PMC course (see “Practical info”). - Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been widely used for chemoprevention in Africa, including for PMC. Artemisinin- based combination therapies (ACTs) have been effective when used for PMC, but evidence is limited on their safety, efficacy, adherence to multi-day regimens, and cost-effectiveness in the context of PMC. - Previously, PMC was recommended in infants (<12 months of age) as intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi). 11 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Since the initial recommendation, new data have documented the value of malaria chemoprevention in children aged 12 to 24 months. - The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) platform remains important for delivering PMC. Other methods of delivery can be explored to optimize access to PMC and integration with other health interventions. - Moderate to high perennial malaria transmission settings are defined as areas withP. falciparumparasite prevalence greater than 10% or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 per 1000[30]. These thresholds are indicative and should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of the PMC recommendation. 4.2.3 Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) Strong recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (2022) In areas of seasonal malaria transmission, children belonging to age groups at high risk of severe malaria should be given antimalarial medicines during peak malaria transmission seasons to reduce disease burden. Remark: - Eligibility for seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is defined by the seasonality of malaria transmission and age groups at risk of severe malaria.

Malaria programmes should assess the suitability of SMC based on the local malaria epidemiology and available funding (see “Practical info”).

The added value of a seasonally targeted intervention is likely to be greatest where transmission is intensely seasonal. - Monthly cycles of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP+AQ) have been widely used for SMC in African children under 5 years old and have been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive (Thwing et alunpublished evidence). 4.2.4 Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in school-aged children (IPTsc) Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in school-aged children (2022) School-aged children living in malaria-endemic settings with moderate to high perennial or seasonal transmission can be given a full therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine at predetermined times as chemoprevention to reduce disease burden. Remark: - Intermittent preventive treatment in school-aged children (IPTsc) has been evaluated in children aged 5–15 years. The burden of malaria and benefits of IPTsc may vary across this age range, but evidence is limited. - National malaria programmes can consider IPTsc if resources allow for its introduction among school-aged children without compromising chemoprevention interventions for those carrying the highest burden of severe disease, such as children < 5 years old. - Schools may provide a low-cost means to deliver chemoprevention to school-aged children. However seasonal variation in malaria transmission and the timing of school terms, as well as equity concerns, may mean alternative delivery channels are needed to maximize impact. - First- and second-line malaria treatments should not be used for IPTsc if safe and effective alternatives are available (see “Practical info”). - The dosing schedule for IPTsc should be informed by the local malaria epidemiology and timed to give protection during the period of greatest malaria risk (see “Practical info”). - Moderate to high malaria transmission settings are defined as areas withP. falciparumparasite prevalence greater than 10% or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 per 1000[30].

Remark: - MDA may quickly reduce clinical malaria incidence in settings with moderate to highP. falciparumtransmission, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria control programme (including good coverage of effective case management and appropriate prevention tools and strategies). - Malaria programmes should judge the suitability of using MDA in their context based on the desired impact, level of endemicity, and resources required. MDA for burden reduction should be targeted at moderate to high transmission settings, regardless of seasonality (see “Practical info”). - Moderate to high malaria transmission settings are defined as areas withP. falciparumparasite prevalence greater than 10%, or incidence greater than 250P. falciparumcases per 1000 population per year[30]. These thresholds should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of MDA implementation. It is biologically plausible that MDA in intermediate transmission settings may reduce both disease burden and transmission intensity. 4.2.6.2 MDA for burden reduction in emergency settings Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence MDA for burden reduction in emergency settings (2022) During emergencies or periods of health service disruption, antimalarial medicine can be used for mass drug administration (MDA) in defined geographical areas to provide short-term reductions in the burden of disease caused byP. falciparum.

However, the biological effects of MDA on disease in non-emergency settings are likely to translate to MDA recipients in emergency settings. The size of effect will vary according to the type of emergency and level of disruption to health services, as well as underlying transmission intensity, choice of drug, delivery method and other factors. 4.2.6.3 MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in very low to low transmission settings Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence MDA to reduce transmission ofP. falciparumin very low to low transmission settings (2022) In areas with very low to low levels ofP. falciparumtransmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention through mass drug administration (MDA) to reduce transmission. Remark: - MDA may quickly reduce transmission ofP. falciparumin very low to low transmission areas, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria elimination programme (including, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance with parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment, and appropriate prevention tools and strategies) in order to reduce the risk of resurgence after the MDA programme has ended. - MDA should be considered only for geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas. - Malaria programmes should consider whether sufficient resources are available to implement MDA without affecting other components of a robust malaria elimination programme. - Very low to low transmission settings are defined as areas withP. falciparumparasite prevalence less than 10%, orP. falciparumincidence less than 250 cases per 1000 population per year[30]. These thresholds should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of MDA implementation for transmission reduction.

Remark: - MDA may quickly reduce transmission ofP. vivax,but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria elimination programme (including, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance with parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment including treatment for hypnozoites, and appropriate prevention tools and strategies) in order to reduce the risk of resurgence after the MDA programme has ended. - MDA should be considered only for geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas. - Malaria programmes should consider whether sufficient resources are available to implement MDA without affecting other components of a robust malaria elimination programme. - Programmes considering implementing MDA forP. vivaxshould carefully reflect on how to safely and feasibly administer treatment to prevent relapses. 4.2.6.6 Mass relapse prevention (MRP) to reduce transmission of P. vivax Conditional recommendation against , Very low certainty evidence Mass relapse prevention (MRP) to reduce transmission ofP. vivax(2022) Mass treatment with an 8-aminoquinoline medicine alone to reduce the transmission ofP. vivaxis not recommended. Remark: - Without testing for G6PD deficiency, the GDG noted the potential for severe harm from the use of a therapeutic dose of an 8-aminoquinoline for radical cure ofP. vivaxhypnozoites.

Remark: - Countries should prioritize vaccination in areas of moderate and high transmission [i]. However, countries may also consider providing the vaccine in low transmission settings. Decisions on expanding malaria vaccination to low transmission settings should be considered at country level on the basis of the overall malaria control strategy, affordability, cost-effectiveness and programmatic considerations, such as whether the inclusion would simplify delivery. - Malaria vaccines should be provided in a four-dose schedule in children from 5 months of age for the reduction of malaria 15 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) disease and burden [ii]. Countries may choose to give the first vaccine dose earlier than 5 months of age on the basis of operational considerations to increase coverage or impact. - The minimum interval between any doses is four weeks; however, to achieve prolonged protection, the fourth dose should be given 6–18 months after the third dose. - To improve coverage, there can be flexibility in the timing of the fourth dose, including by aligning it with vaccines given in the second year of life. Alternatively, because the vaccine efficacy is highest in the first months after vaccination, the fourth dose can be given just prior to seasonal peaks in malaria transmission to optimize vaccine efficacy. - A fifth dose, given one year after the fourth dose, may be provided in areas of highly seasonal transmission and may be considered in other areas where a significant malaria risk remains for children, depending on a local assessment of feasibility and cost-effectiveness. - In areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission or perennial malaria transmission with seasonal peaks, countries may consider providing the vaccine using an age-based or seasonal approach. Alternatively, countries could consider a hybrid of these approaches, giving the first three doses through age-based administration and subsequent annual doses seasonally [iii]. - At the time of vaccine introduction, catch-up vaccination can be considered in children up to 5 years of age, subject to local epidemiology and age of high risk, feasibility, affordability and vaccine availability. - Malaria vaccines should be provided as part of a comprehensive malaria control strategy. All malaria control interventions, including vaccines, provide partial protection; the highest impact is achieved when a mix of interventions is used. Appropriate mixes of interventions (ITNs, preventive chemotherapies, vaccines, etc.) should be identified for different subnational settings.

All malaria control interventions, including vaccines, provide partial protection; the highest impact is achieved when a mix of interventions is used. Appropriate mixes of interventions (ITNs, preventive chemotherapies, vaccines, etc.) should be identified for different subnational settings. These mixes are defined by national malaria programmes on the basis of the local malaria epidemiology (e.g. intensity of transmission, age pattern of severe disease, vector species and behaviour, and insecticide and drug resistance patterns) and contextual factors (e.g. structure and function of the health care system). [i] Moderate and high transmission settings are defined as areas with aP. falciparumparasite prevalence greater than 10% PfPR2-10or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 cases per 1000 population. These thresholds are indicative and should not be regarded as absolutes for determining the applicability of the malaria vaccine recommendation. [ii] Although the WHO prequalification issued for the RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccines permits children to receive the first dose from 5 months of age, the RTS,S/AS01 manufacturer’s licensure specifies from 6 weeks to 17 months of age. Studies with RTS,S/AS01 indicated lower efficacy if the first dose was given around 6 weeks of age. However, the efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M vaccines is unlikely to be reduced substantially if the first dose is given at 4, rather than 5, months of age. [iii] Anage-based vaccination approachprovides the first three vaccine doses when children become age-eligible (with a minimum of four weeks between doses) and a fourth dose 6–18 months after the third dose. Aseasonal vaccination approachprovides the first three vaccine doses just prior to the malaria transmission season (with a minimum of four weeks between doses) and subsequent doses just prior to the transmission season. A hybrid vaccination approach involves giving the first three doses through an age-based approach and subsequent doses just prior to the transmission season. 5. Case management 5.1 Diagnosing malaria Practice Statement Diagnosing malaria (2015) All cases of suspected malaria should have a parasitological test (microscopy or RDT) to confirm the diagnosis. Both microscopy and RDTs should be supported by a quality assurance programme. 5.2 Treating malaria 5.2.1 Treating uncomplicated malaria 5.2.1.1 Artemisinin-based combination therapy Strong recommendation for , High certainty evidence Artemisinin-based combination therapy (2015) 16 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Children and adults with uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria should be treated with one of the following ACTs*: - artemether-lumefantrine (AL) - artesunate-amodiaquine (AS+AQ) - artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) - dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAP) - artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) - artesunate-pyronaridine (ASPY) (2022) *Artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate-pyronaridine are not recommended for use in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Strong recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Artesunate-pyronaridine for uncomplicated malaria (2022) Artesunate-pyronaridine (ASPY) is recommended as an artemisinin-based combination therapy option for the treatment of uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria. Remark: - ASPY should be avoided by individuals with known liver disease (clinically apparent liver disease) because ASPY is associated with liver transaminitis. - Pharmacovigilance should be strengthened where ASPY is used for the treatment of malaria. 5.2.1.1.1 Duration of treatment Strong recommendation for , High certainty evidence Duration of ACT treatment (2015) ACT regimens should provide 3 days’ treatment with an artemisinin derivative. 5.2.1.1.2 Dosing of ACTs Strong recommendation for Revised dose recommendation for dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine in young children (2015) Children weighing <25kg treated with dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine should receive a minimum of 2.5 mg/ kg bw per day of dihydroartemisinin and 20 mg/ kg bw per day of piperaquine daily for 3 days. *Not evaluated using the GRADE framework 5.2.1.2 Recurrent falciparum malaria 5.2.1.3 Reducing the transmissibility of treated P. falciparum infections in areas of low- intensity transmission Strong recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Reducing the transmissibility of treatedP. falciparuminfections (2024) 17 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) In low-transmission areas, a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg bw primaquine should be given with an ACT to patients withP. falciparummalaria (except pregnant women) to reduce transmission. G6PD testing is not required. 5.2.1.4 Special risk groups 5.2.1.4.1 Pregnant and lactating women Strong recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Treatment in the first trimester of pregnancy (2022) Pregnant women with uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria should be treated with artemether-lumefantrine during the first trimester. Remark: - Limited exposures to other ACTs (artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine and dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine) suggest that the current evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation for routine use of these other ACTs in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, consistent with the previous WHO recommendation that provided for limited use of ACTs if the first-line recommended medicine was not available, these other ACTs may be considered for use where artemether-lumefantrine is not a recommended ACT for uncomplicated malaria or is not available, given the demonstrated poorer outcomes of quinine treatment, along with the challenges of adherence to a seven-day course of treatment. - Antifolates are contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Strong recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Primaquine as anti-relapse therapy (2024) To prevent relapse, children and adult (except pregnant women, infants aged < 1 months and women breastfeeding infants aged < 1 months, and people with G6PD deficiency), primaquine should be given at a high total dose (7 mg/kg) at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days or 1 mg/kg/day for 7 days for prevention of relapses in patients with uncomplicatedP. vivaxorP. ovalemalaria. Remark: - The primaquine high dose (7 mg/kg) should be provided at 1 mg/kg/day for 7 days only to patients with ≥70% G6PD activity. - National decisions regarding the two high-dose (7 mg/kg) primaquine regimens given over 7 or 14 days will be affected by the availability of G6PD semi-quantitative testing and capacity for supervised therapy. - Evidence for the magnitude of benefit may vary geographically. Whether a high dose of primaquine 7 mg/kg is given in 14 days or 7 days, the absolute benefit of using the high primaquine total dose will vary according to the risk of recurrence in the population. The benefits are higher in Africa, South-East Asia and Oceania. However, in areas on the Indian subcontinent and in the Americas, where the absolute benefit of a total high dose of 7 mg/kg might be only marginally greater than that of 3.5 mg/kg, primaquine at a low 3.5 mg/kg total dose might be used. 20 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - It should be emphasized that determination of G6PD status using appropriate test is needed to guide the safe administration of primaquine (see section 5.2.1.6 on G6PD testing).

Once a patient has received at least 24 h of parenteral therapy and can tolerate oral therapy, treatment should be completed with 3 days of an ACT. Strong recommendation for Treating severe malaria in children (2015) Children weighing < 20 kg should receive a higher dose of artesunate (3 mg/kg bw per dose) than larger children and adults (2.4 mg/kg bw per dose) to ensure equivalent exposure to the drug. *Not evaluated using the GRADE framework; recommendation based on pharmacokinetic modelling 5.2.2.2 Parenteral alternatives when artesunate is not available Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Parental alternatives when artesunate is not available (2015) If artesunate is not available, artemether should be used in preference to quinine for treating children and adults with severe malaria. 5.2.2.3 Pre-referral treatment options Strong recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Pre-referral treatment options (2015) 21 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Where complete treatment of severe malaria is not possible, but injections are available, adults and children should be given a single intramuscular dose of artesunate, and referred to an appropriate facility for further care. Where intramuscular artesunate is not available, intramuscular artemether or, if that is not available, intramuscular quinine should be used. Where intramuscular injection of artesunate is not available, children < 6 years should be treated with a single rectal dose (10mg/kg bw) of artesunate, and referred immediately to an appropriate facility for further care. Rectal artesunate should not be used in older children and adults. 5.2.3 Other considerations in treating malaria 5.2.3.1 Management of malaria cases in special situations 5.2.3.2 Quality of antimalarial drugs Practice Statement Antimalarial drug quality (2015) National drug and regulatory authorities should ensure that the antimalarial medicines provided in both the public and the private sectors are of acceptable quality, through regulation, inspection and law enforcement. 5.2.3.3 Monitoring efficacy and safety of antimalarial drugs and resistance Practice Statement Monitoring efficacy and safety of antimalarial drugs and resistance (2010) All malaria programmes should regularly monitor the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs using the standard WHO protocols.

Remark: - Persons given antimalarials should be those with increased risk of infection compared to the general population and their infections should constitute a large proportion of the parasite reservoir in the area. - The factors identifying individuals or groups at increased risk of infection should be easy to recognise, thereby improving the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. - Programmes considering implementing targeted drug administration forP. vivaxshould carefully consider how to safely and feasibly administer treatment to prevent relapses. - Care should be taken to avoid stigmatizing groups at increased risk of infection. - Additional complementary strategies to eliminate or prevent re-establishment of malaria transmission should be in place. 6.2.2 Targeted testing and treatment (TTaT) Conditional recommendation against , Very low certainty evidence Targeted testing and treatment to reduce transmission of malaria (2022) Testing and treatment of people with an increased risk of infection relative to the general population to reduce the transmission of malaria is not recommended. Remark: The GDG noted that there may be limited circumstances under which targeted testing and treatment (TTaT) could be beneficial. For example, TTaT could be used when people at a higher risk of infection can be easily identified and chemoprevention is not acceptable to the population. Additionally, TTaT could be used if safe and effective implementation of radical cure to preventP. vivaxrelapses is only feasible for those with confirmed infections. 6.2.3 Testing and treatment at points of entry to reduce importation of malaria Conditional recommendation against , Very low certainty evidence 24 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Routine malaria testing and treatment at points of entry (2022) Routine malaria testing and treatment of people arriving at points of entry (land, sea or air) to reduce importation is not recommended.

This strategy may be particularly critical to areas in post-elimination that are working to prevent re- establishment of transmission. 6.3 Interventions in response to detection of confirmed malaria cases 6.3.1 Reactive drug administration (RDA) Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Reactive drug administration for reducing malaria transmission (2022) In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention to all people residing with or near a confirmed malaria case and all people who share the same risk of infection (e.g. co-travellers and co-workers) to prevent or reduce malaria transmission. Remark: - Programmes implementing reactive drug administration (RDA) should have the capacity to conduct case investigations at the residence to determine the likely location of infection and to identify those individuals co-exposed with the index case. - Programmes implementing RDA should have the capacity to enumerate and provide antimalarials to the people residing with or near a confirmed malaria case and others that share the same risk of infection. - The people given antimalarial medicine in an RDA intervention should share the same risk of having acquired infection as the index case or be at risk of acquiring infection from the index case. This includes residents in the same household or neighborhood, co-travellers and co-workers. However, if the infection was imported and the residence is not located in a receptive area, there may be no benefit from RDA. - Programmes contemplating implementation of RDA forP. vivaxshould carefully consider how to safely and feasibly administer treatment to prevent relapses. 6.3.2 Reactive case detection and treatment (RACDT) Conditional recommendation for , Very low certainty evidence Reactive case detection and treatment to reduce transmission of malaria (2022) In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, all people residing with or near a confirmed malaria case and all people who share the same risk of infection (e.g. co-travellers and co-workers) can be tested for malaria and treated if positive. 25 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Remark: Until an area is nearing elimination or is post-elimination, it is unlikely that reactive case detection and treatment (RACDT) will have any effect on malaria transmission.

Remark: - In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings where proactive indoor residual spraying (IRS) is occurring, programmes can consider switching to reactive IRS only, depending on the receptivity of the area. - Programmes considering adding reactive IRS on top of proactive IRS should balance the potential added benefit with increasing cost and the risk of insecticide resistance. - In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings where no IRS is occurring, initiating reactive IRS may be beneficial, depending on whether IRS is a suitable vector control strategy. IRS is most effective where the vector population is susceptible to the insecticide(s) being applied, the majority of mosquitoes feed and rest indoors and where most structures are suitable for spraying. - If the index infection was imported and the residence is not located in a receptive area, there may be no benefit from reactive IRS. 7.

The recommendations for malaria vaccines have been developed following the procedures of the WHOStrategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization 29 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) (SAGE). WHO uses strictly defined processes to assess the quality, consistency and completeness of evidence to determine the strength of each recommendation. WHO malaria recommendations are intended to be short, evidence-based, actionable statements. They are usually accompanied by supplementary remarks drawing attention to contextual and implementation considerations that may influence the appropriateness and impact of a recommendation in different settings. Clearly distinguishing recommendations from their associated contextual considerations provides information national policy-makers to consider when adopting and adapting the recommended strategies that are most appropriate in their settings. This online platform and the associated PDF help to distinguish the formal recommendations from the supplementary statements. The Global Malaria Programme will use this platform to produce “living guidelines”, which can be updated more rapidly than printed documents as new evidence becomes available. The tabs below each recommendation enable users to access the research evidence and evidence- to-decision (EtD) frameworks that informed the recommendation. There is also a feedback tab where users are encouraged to provide input directly related to each intervention. Scope The consolidatedWHO Guidelines for malariabring together all recommendations for malaria, including prevention using vector control, preventive chemotherapy and the vaccine; diagnosis, treatment and elimination strategies. The Guidelines also provide links to other resources including unpublished evidence reviewed at the time of formulating recommendations, guidance and information on strategic use of information to drive impact, surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, operational manuals, handbooks and frameworks, and a glossary of terms and definitions. The Guidelines provide: - evidence-based recommendations pertaining to vector control tools, technologies and approaches that are currently available for malaria prevention and control, and for which sufficient evidence on their efficacy is available to support systematic reviews. The Guidelines are intended to provide an underlying framework for the design of effective, evidence-based national vector control strategies and their adaptation to local disease epidemiology and vector bionomics; - evidence-based recommendations on the use of antimalarial medicines as preventive chemotherapy in people livingin malaria- endemic areas who are at risk of malaria morbidity and mortality. These approaches include intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in pregnancy (IPTp), perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment in school aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA); - evidence-based recommendation on the use of the malaria vaccine; - evidence-based recommendations on the treatment of uncomplicated and severe malaria in all age groups and situations, including in young children and pregnant women; and - guidance on interventions in the final phase of elimination and prevention of re-establishment. No guidance is given on the use of antimalarial agents to prevent malaria in people travelling from non-endemic settings to areas of malaria transmission.

WHO guidelines, recommendations and good practice statements A WHO guideline is any document developed by WHO containing recommendations for clinical practice, or public health practice or health policy. A recommendation informs the intended end-user what he or she can or should do in specific situations to achieve the best possible health outcomes, individually and/or collectively. It guides the choice among different interventions or measures to ensure a positive impact on health and implications for the use of resources. In certain situations, good practice statements may be provided. These statements reflect the consensus of the Guidelines Development Group (GDG) that the benefits of adhering to the intervention or course of action are large and unequivocal, and do not need to be supported by a systematic evidence review or could be based on indirect evidence. The primary purpose of these WHO Guidelines is to support policy-makers in ministries of health and the managers of national malaria control programmes in endemic countries to establish national policies and plans tailored to their local context. Link to WHO prequalification When a recommendation is linked to the introduction of a new tool or product, there is a parallel process managed by the WHO Prequalification Team to ensure that diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and vector control products meet global standards of quality, safety and efficacy, in order to optimize use of health resources and improve health outcomes. The prequalification process consists of a transparent, scientifically sound assessment, including dossier review, consistency testing or performance evaluation, and site visits to manufacturers. This information, in conjunction with other procurement criteria, is used by the United Nations (UN) and other procurement agencies to make purchasing decisions regarding these health products. This parallel process aims to ensure that recommendations are linked to prequalified products and that prequalified products are linked to a recommendation for use. 30 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Expert input is important for the interpretation of the evidence, and the development of guidance may rely on expert opinion, particularly in areas where the evidence is currently weak, scarce or absent.

Updating evidence-based guidance The first edition of these consolidated Guidelines was released in early 2021 as a compilation of the existing recommendations for malaria vector control and treatment. This version of the Guidelines includes revised information regarding the WHO recommendation for use of indoor residual spraying (IRS) to prevent malaria. The update was informed by a GDG review of data related to efficacy and contextual factors for two new insecticides for use in IRS (chlorfenapyr and isocycloseram). While the overarching recommendation remains largely unchanged, the evidence profiles have been updated with the addition of these two new insecticides, and there is an emphasis on continuing to reduce the use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) for IRS for malaria control. There is also a new recommendation for spatial emanators (also known as spatial repellents), in light of new evidence on the use of this intervention. Future updates for treatment include recommendations that are already in the Guidelines but for which the evidence was not previously subjected to the GRADE process, and new molecules under development that will be included once the evidence base becomes available. Readers should note the dates of individual recommendations. Revisions to these Guidelines will be communicated via the Global Malaria Programme website and through WHO’s standard dissemination channels. From this point forward, these consolidated Guidelines represent the latest and definitive reference for all WHO guidance on malaria.

Introduction Background Malaria continues to cause unacceptably high levels of disease and death, as documented in successive editions of theWorld malaria report[3]. According to the latest report, there were an estimated263 million cases and 597 000 malaria deathsglobally in 2023. Malaria is preventable and treatable, and the global priority is to reduce the burden of disease and death while retaining the long-term 31 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) vision of malaria eradication. Here, we present theWHO Guidelines for malariadeveloped by the WHO Global Malaria Programme as a comprehensive and inclusive resource for advice on malaria. TheGlobal technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030[4](GTS) provides an overarching framework to guide malaria control and elimination efforts. Adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015 and update adopted in May 2021, the Strategy defines goals, milestones and targets on the path to a world free of malaria (Table 1). The goals focus attention on the need to both reduce morbidity and mortality, and to progressively eliminate malaria from countries that had malaria transmission in 2015. The GTS presents a framework through which the goals can be achieved (Figure 1). Table 1. Goals, milestones and targets for theGlobal technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030 Goals Milestones Targets 2020 2025 2030 1.

Ensure access to malaria Accelerate efforts towards Transform malaria surveillance into prevention elimination andattainmentof a key interventions malaria-free status Supportingelement1. Harnessinginnovation and expanding research Supportingelement2. Strengtheningthe enabling environment for sustainable and equitable results The second pillar of the GTS urges all countries to accelerate efforts towards elimination and attainment of a malaria-free status. Progress towards elimination is a continuous process and not a set of independent stages. Countries, subnational areas and communities are situated at different points along the malaria transmission continuum. Malaria transmission intensity varies within a country or area, as does the level of investment, biological determinants, environmental factors, strength of health systems and social, demographic, political and economic factors. Strategies will need to be tailored to the local setting by taking into account the local context and epidemiology of malaria. The principal objective of national malaria programmes (NMPs) is to combine a selection of these interventions into packages that are tailored to achieve sustainable and equitable impact in a given setting. To decide upon the appropriate intervention package and allocation of resources that will achieve this objective and contribute to UHC, programmes should use a process that combines the analysis of impact and value for money with extensive stakeholder engagement and discussion. The process should be informed by past and current malaria transmission intensity and incidence data; contextual vulnerability related to the human host, parasites, vectors, and past and present intervention coverage; acceptability; and equality of access and use (including analysis of financial barriers and how to address 32 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) them). When the objective is elimination, a similar process is undertaken, although the types of interventions and value for money analysis will be different than in high-burden settings. Following progressive reductions in malaria burden between 2000 and 2015, progress stalled. By 2017, the world was off track to achieve the malaria morbidity and mortality reduction targets. In response, a revitalization effort called “High burden to high impact(HBHI)” was launched in 2018[5].This approach focuses attention on how to get back on track: garnering political will to reduce the toll of malaria; using strategic information to drive impact; developing better guidance, policies and strategies; and improving coordination of support for national malaria responses. Although the impetus for articulating these key activities was the need to get back on track to achieve the GTS morbidity and mortality", "page_start": 32, "page_end": 33, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Objectives These consolidatedWHO Guidelines for malariaaim to provide the latest evidence-based recommendations in one reference to support countries in their efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate malaria. The objectives of the Guidelines are: - to provide evidence-based and context-sensitive recommendations on the appropriate choice(s) for malaria prevention (vector control, preventive chemotherapies and the vaccine), case management (diagnosis and treatment) across all transmission settings and interventions in the final phase of elimination and prevention of re-establishment; - to support WHO Member States in the development of national malaria policies for prevention and case management across all transmission settings; - to encourage the use of local data to inform subnational stratification to maximize the impact of available resources; and - to inform the research agenda to enable updates to the Guidelines by identifying gaps in evidence that constrain the development of guidance or weaken current recommendations. Evidence base These Guidelines are based on the synthesis of the available evidence on the health effects of interventions, and the grading of the certainty of that evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. The synthesized and graded evidence on the health effects of interventions, as well as any evidence on contextual factors, is used to develop an evidence-to-decision (EtD) framework for each recommendation[6]. The judgement of the expert panel on the different factors in the EtD framework (including the certainty of evidence) is transparently captured and facilitates the determination of the strength and direction of each recommendation. Expert input is important for the interpretation of the evidence, and the development of guidance may rely on expert opinion, particularly in areas where the evidence is currently weak, scarce or absent. For example, the vector control recommendations presented in the Guidelines are based on a consideration of the evidence gained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other types of trials and studies, as well as the technical knowledge and experience of the GDG and External Review Group involved in the standard guideline development process. Details of how evidence is considered are presented in Section 8: Methods. Details of contributors for specific recommendations are presented in Section 10: Contributors and interests. Target audience The primary audience for these Guidelines is policy-makers in ministries of health and the managers of NMPs in endemic countries. The Guidelines may also be of interest to health care practitioners, environmental health service professionals, procurement agencies, the private sector,", "page_start": 33, "page_end": 33, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The Guidelines may also be of interest to health care practitioners, environmental health service professionals, procurement agencies, the private sector, and civil society groups. The Guidelines are also intended for use by international development partners, donors and funding agencies in order to support decision-making on allocation of resources for interventions and procurement of appropriate malaria control products. In addition, the Guidelines are intended to guide researchers, research funders and those interested in the outcomes of research to address the evidence gaps that are constraining the development of guidance or weakening current recommendations. Equity, gender and human rights The right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (commonly referred to as the right to health) is enshrined in several international human rights treaties, regional agreements, and national constitutions and laws. Member States have minimum “core” obligations that include “the prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases”[7]. Yet, gender-based discrimination, human rights violations, and inequities related to social, economic, environmental, commercial and political determinants of health deprive billions of people around the world of their right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health and well-being. It is of great concern that, over the past few years, health inequities have been exacerbated by the impacts of the ongoing and interlinked crises of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), conflict, climate change, food insecurity and the global economy. Too many people are missing out on the interventions they need to keep them healthy, including interventions to prevent and treat malaria. According to a WHO report[8], malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS are diseases that predominantly impact the chronically disadvantaged. While the magnitude and extent of health inequalities remain poorly understood, it is clear that certain population groups have persistently higher 33 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) disease mortality and morbidity and more limited access to life-saving interventions. The report documents that the poorest, least educated and rural groups are less likely to seek care for children with fever. In most countries, Member States have not adequately identified and addressed social and structural barriers to health, or taken action to ensure gender equality, equity and human rights. Communities are often excluded from health decision-making, even though people are entitled to active, free and meaningful participation in decisions that directly affect them, such as the design, implementation and monitoring of health interventions. Participation increases ownership and helps to ensure that policies and programmes are responsive to the needs of the people they are intended to benefit. The existing inequities are barriers to achieving global and national goals and targets on malaria.", "page_start": 33, "page_end": 34, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Participation increases ownership and helps to ensure that policies and programmes are responsive to the needs of the people they are intended to benefit. The existing inequities are barriers to achieving global and national goals and targets on malaria. Successful implementation of malaria control interventions should, therefore, be viewed through a human rights and health equity lens. This means fully acknowledging the importance of engaging people in the design and delivery of health and care systems to meet their needs, and empowering them to make informed decisions about their health and take action. As many of the malaria interventions are reliant on broader health care delivery platforms, a rights-based approach is required to ensure that quality health services and programmes are available, accessible and acceptable to all those in need, including nomadic populations, individuals with disabilities, out-of-school youth, and those living in sparsely populated and underserved areas far from health services and schools. National programmes should address inequity concerns by monitoring the coverage of recommended interventions among individuals in identified risk categories and targeting those most at risk. Health inequities and barriers to health need to be systematically identified and addressed by Member States and other stakeholders through gender-responsive, equitable and human rights-based health systems, with a focus on individuals and groups experiencing intersecting forms of discrimination, marginalization and/or social exclusion. Etiology Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by the infection of red blood cells with protozoan parasites of the genusPlasmodiumthat are transmitted to people through the bites of infected femaleAnophelesmosquitoes. Four species ofPlasmodium(P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariaeandP. ovale) most commonly infect humans.P. falciparumandP. vivaxare the most prevalent species andP. falciparumis the most dangerous. A fifth species,P. knowlesi(a species ofPlasmodiumthat primarily infects non-human primates) is increasingly being reported in humans inhabiting forested regions of some countries of South-East Asia and the Western Pacific regions, and in particular on the island of Borneo. Malaria transmission, acquisition of immunity, and clinical manifestations of disease The intensity of transmission depends on factors related to the parasite, the vector, the human host and the environment. Transmission tends to be more intense in places where the mosquito lifespan is longer and where the females prefer to bite humans rather than other animals. The survival and longevity of female mosquitoes is of critical importance in malaria transmission, as the malaria parasite generally requires a period of 7–10 days to develop inside the mosquito into a form that is infective to humans. Female mosquito longevity is dependent on intrinsic, genetic factors, as well as on environmental factors including temperature and humidity. The strong human- biting habit of the African vector species is one of the reasons why approximately 90% of the world’s malaria cases occur in Africa. Transmission intensity is usually assessed as the incidence", "page_start": 34, "page_end": 34, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The strong human- biting habit of the African vector species is one of the reasons why approximately 90% of the world’s malaria cases occur in Africa. Transmission intensity is usually assessed as the incidence of cases or the prevalence of infection. Most countries have information on the annual parasite incidence (number of new parasitologically confirmed malaria cases per 1000 population per year) from routine surveillance and/or on the parasite prevalence from surveys, often conducted during or just after periods of peak transmission[9]. The following categories of transmission intensity are indicative and meant to provide an adaptable framework in which each country can conduct a stratification exercise to classify geographical units according to local malaria transmission. - Areas of high transmission are characterized by an annual parasite incidence of 450 or more cases per 1000 population and aP. falciparumprevalence rate of ≥35%. - Moderate transmission areas have an annual parasite incidence of 250–450 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence ofP. falciparum/P. vivaxmalaria of 10–35%. - Areas of low transmission have an annual parasite incidence of 100–250 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence ofP. falciparum/P. vivaxof 1–10%. It should be noted that the incidence of cases or infections is a more useful measure in geographical units in which the prevalence is low, given the difficulty of measuring prevalence accurately at low levels[10]. - Very low transmission areas have an annual parasite incidence of < 100 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence ofP. falciparum/P. vivaxmalaria that is > 0 but < 1%. The relation between parasite incidence, parasite prevalence and the number of cases presenting to health facilities per week can be estimated using models[11]. Differences in transmission from one area to another may be due to geographical characteristics, such as altitude, temperature, humidity, rainfall patterns, proximity to water bodies, land use, vector species and distribution, socio-demographic characteristics, access to antimalarial treatment, and coverage with vector control. In most endemic areas, seasonal patterns of 34 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) transmission are observed, with high transmission during part of the year. Both the intensity and timing of transmission are important considerations in designing elimination strategies. The manifestation of clinical disease depends strongly on the background level of acquired protective immunity, which is a consequence of the pattern and intensity of malaria transmission in the area of residence. In areas of moderate to high transmission, partial immunity to clinical disease and a reduced risk of developing severe malaria are acquired in early childhood. The pattern of acquired immunity is similar across the Sahel subregion, where malaria transmission is intense only during the three- or four-month rainy season and low at other times.

The pattern of acquired immunity is similar across the Sahel subregion, where malaria transmission is intense only during the three- or four-month rainy season and low at other times. In both these situations, clinical disease is confined mainly to young children, who may develop high parasite densities that can progress rapidly to severe malaria. By contrast, in these settings, adolescents and adults are partially immune and suffer clinical disease much less frequently, although they are often infected with low blood-parasite densities. Immunity is modified in pregnancy and gradually lost, at least partially, when individuals move out of the endemic areas for prolonged periods (e.g. a year or more). In areas of low and very low transmission, as found in much of Asia, Latin America and other malaria-endemic areas, the transmission fluctuates widely by season, year, and over relatively small distances.P. vivaxis an important cause of malaria in these regions. This generally low transmission delays acquisition of immunity, so that adults and children alike suffer from acute clinical malaria, with a significant risk for progression to severe malaria if left untreated. Epidemics may occur in these low or very low transmission areas when the inoculation rate increases rapidly because of a sudden increase in vectorial capacity. Epidemics may result in a very high incidence across all age groups, which can overwhelm health services. In moderate and high transmission areas with sustained high coverage of vector control and access to treatment, reduced exposure to malaria infection may change the population structure of acquired immunity to reflect that found in low or very low transmission areas, resulting in a corresponding change in the clinical epidemiology of malaria and an increasing risk of epidemics if control measures are not sustained. Recommendations and supporting implementation guidance Evidence-informed recommendations are a critical component to support the development of national malaria strategic plans; they are intended to communicate “what to do”. A second critical element is the strategic use of local data. This informs an understanding of the contextual diversity within each malaria-endemic country. Local data provide an understanding of the different types of settings – or strata – within each country. This is an essential prerequisite to identify the optimal mix of interventions and the best means to deliver them in the different subnational strata. The Global Malaria Programme is working with countries to strengthen the generation and use of local information for stratification, the definition of optimal mixes of interventions, and the rational, safe and ethical prioritization of resourcesto maximize impact.

TheGuiding principles for prioritizing malaria interventions in resource-constrained country contexts to achieve maximum impact[12]provide a framework for country decision-making to define the most appropriate mix of malaria interventions for specific geographical areas or risk groups when resources are constrained. Local data are also essential to understand the impact of the strategies deployed, providing opportunities to further refine sub-national strategies and inform global knowledge. WHO also develops implementation guidance such as operational and field manuals to support the “how” aspect of delivering the recommended tools and strategies. Operational manuals and other guidance hold practical information for increasing the target population's access to interventions. These documents are referenced and linked to these Guidelines. The Global Malaria Programme is working to align this implementation guidance with the recommendations in theWHO Guidelines for malaria. However, where there are inconsistencies, the Guidelines should be the default resource for national decisions. Countries may use the implementation guidance to define ways in which a recommendation can be implemented effectively – for example, intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy could be implemented through antenatal care and/or community distribution. The intention of the guidance is to enable delivery, not to prescribe exactly how it should be done. Strategic information to tailor programmatic response and selection of interventions As malaria control improves, malaria transmission and risk become increasingly heterogeneous, both between and within countries. Thus, a “one-size-fits all” approach to programme decisions on intervention selection becomes inefficient. The situation requires stratification of the country at subnational levels according to past, present and future malaria risk, the structure and function of the health system,and other contextual factors. Stratification provides a rational basis to identify context-specific packages of interventions to target specific populations in the different subnational strata. Local data are essential to complete stratification and to inform the selection of the optimal mixes of interventions to maximize impact. Given that resource constraints usually limit the implementation of all desirable interventions in all areas of malaria risk, a prioritization exercise must also be conducted to ensure that resource allocation also optimizes intervention mixes and resultantimpact. Guidance on these activities is available in Section 7: Surveillance. The choice of interventions in each stratum should be informed by WHO’s recommendations. However, given the complexities of malaria, with heterogeneity of risk and the unique contexts that every programme has to consider, global guidance is not intended and should not be used to provide prescriptive guidance on what should be done in every situation. These Guidelines signal a paradigm shift towards a 35 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) problem-solving approach using local data to identify recommendations that are relevant at a country level and based on local context,defining stratum-specificpackages of interventions", "page_start": 35, "page_end": 36, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

This shift moves away from overly prescriptive recommendations and will clearly distinguish evidence-informed recommendations from contextual considerations. The contextual considerations at national and subnational levels will inform how recommendations should be applied and strategies that may increase access for the target population. Accurate stratification of malaria transmission intensity is essential for effective targeting of interventions. As countries progress towards elimination, finer scale mapping is required, and stratification should be more specific, ideally at the level of localities or health facility catchment areas[13][14]. As transmission intensity is progressively reduced, stratification needs to include vulnerability and receptivity to malaria, i.e. the risk for importation of malaria cases and the inherent potential of the vector-human ecosystem to transmit malaria. The Guidelines provide a framework within which NMPs and their implementing partners may adopt and adapt the recommendations for use. Good quality surveillance data can also feed into this process by providing the granular local information needed to inform and evaluate national programme decisions (see Section 7: Surveillance). Where the boundaries of current knowledge are pushed, it is particularly important to ensure adequate attention to monitoring and evaluation. The information generated can then feed into updated guidance. 4. Prevention Nearly half of the world’s population is at risk of malaria. In areas with high malaria transmission, young children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to malaria infection and death. Since 2000, expanded access to WHO-recommended malaria prevention tools and strategies – including effective vector control and the use of preventive chemotherapies– has had a major impact in reducing the global burden of this disease. 4.1 Vector control Background The consolidated Guidelines incorporate: i) recommendations based on systematic reviews of the available evidence on the effectiveness of vector control interventions conducted since the launch of the Guidelines; and ii) existing WHO recommendations developed previously. The Guidelines commence by providing general recommendations on malaria vector control, followed by more specific recommendations on individual interventions and good practice statements on their deployment. The interventions are divided into categories of those recommended for large-scale deployment and those recommended as supplementary. Interventions that are recommended for large-scale deployment are those that have demonstrated public health value, i.e. have proven protective efficacy to reduce or prevent infection and/or disease in humans at the individual level, community level or both, and that are broadly applicable for populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings.

Malaria vector control interventions recommended for large-scale deployment are: i) ITNs that are prequalified by WHO, which in many settings continue to be pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs); and ii) indoor residual spraying (IRS) with a product prequalified by WHO. Specific product choices within these broad intervention types should be informed by insecticide resistance data for the target area(s) and other information compiled during sub-national prioritization exercises. Once optimal coverage with one of these interventions has been achieved, supplementary interventions may be considered for deployment depending on the specifics of the population, situation or setting. These include personal protection measures that have a primary use-pattern of protecting individual users, although they may have some as yet unproven impact when deployed at the community level. Vectors, their behaviour and distribution Malaria is transmitted through the bites of infective femaleAnophelesmosquitoes. Of the more than 400 different species of Anophelesmosquitoes, only around 40 are malaria vectors of major importance.Anophelesmosquitoes lay their eggs in water. The eggs hatch to produce larvae, which undergo several moults before emerging from the pupal stage as adult mosquitoes. Different species ofAnophelesmosquitoes have their own preferred aquatic habitats; for example, some prefer small, shallow collections of fresh water such as puddles and animal hoof prints, whereas others prefer large, open water bodies including lakes, swamps and rice fields. Both male and female mosquitoes feed on plant nectar, but it is just the female mosquitoes that feed on blood as they require protein to develop their eggs. Different mosquito species demonstrate preferences for feeding on animals (zoophily) or on humans (anthropophily); however, these preferences are not absolute, and females may take a blood meal from non-preferred hosts when these are present in the area. Different hosts may be more or less attractive to mosquitoes than others. Several factors have been implicated in the attraction of female mosquitoes to a host, including exhaled carbon dioxide, lactic acid, host odours, warmth and moisture. Blood-feeding can take place inside human habitations (endophagy) or outdoors (exophagy), depending on the mosquito species, and this has implications for the selection and effectiveness of vector control interventions. 36 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) FemaleAnophelesmosquitoes blood feed predominantly at night, although some species may bite during the day in heavily shaded conditions, and some exhibit a peak in biting activity in the early evening or early morning.

The blood-feeding preferences (zoophily/ anthropophily, endophagy/exophagy) as well as the interplay between the peak biting time ofAnophelesvectors and the activity and sleeping patterns of the human hosts has important consequences for malaria transmission and the choice of appropriate vector control interventions. After blood-feeding, female mosquitoes rest in order to digest the blood meal and mature their eggs. Female mosquitoes may rest indoors (endophily) or outdoors (exophily), and this depends on innate species preferences as well as the availability of suitable resting sites in the local environment. The mosquitoes’ choice of post-feeding resting site should also be considered when selecting appropriate control interventions. It is important to note that while an individual species ofAnopheleswill characteristically exhibit certain biting and resting behaviours, these are not absolute; subpopulations and individuals may exhibit different behaviours depending on a combination of intrinsic genetic factors, availability of preferred hosts and availability of suitable resting sites. Environmental and climatic factors, including rainfall, moonlight, wind speed, etc., as well as the deployment of vector control interventions can all influence biting and resting behaviours. Accurate species identification is crucial for all studies and surveillance activities on field populations of vectors. Many of the vectors belong to species complexes and require advanced molecular analyses for species identification, necessitating appropriate laboratory resources. Without accurate species identification, the data collected on behaviour, distribution and infection rates will have limited use for decision-making by control programmes. Background and rationale for vector control The role of arthropods in the transmission of diseases to humans was first elucidated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since effective vaccines or drugs were not always available for the prevention or treatment of these diseases, control of transmission often had to rely principally on control of the vector. Early control activities included the screening of houses, the use of mosquito nets, the drainage or filling of swamps and other water bodies used by insects for breeding, and the application of oil or Paris green to breeding places. Following the discovery of the insecticidal properties of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in the 1940s and subsequent discovery of other insecticides, the focus of malaria vector control shifted to the deployment of insecticides to target both the larval and adult stages of mosquito vectors. Nowadays, it is well established that effective vector control programmes can make a major contribution to advancing human and economic development. Aside from direct health benefits, reductions in vector-borne diseases enable greater productivity and growth, reduce household poverty, increase equity and women’s empowerment, and strengthen health systems[15]. Despite the clear evidence in broad support of vector control efforts, the major vector-borne diseases combined still account for around 17% of the estimated global burden of communicable diseases, claiming more than 700 000 lives every year[16].", "page_start": 37, "page_end": 37, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Despite the clear evidence in broad support of vector control efforts, the major vector-borne diseases combined still account for around 17% of the estimated global burden of communicable diseases, claiming more than 700 000 lives every year[16]. Recognizing the great potential to enhance efforts in this area, WHO led the development of theGlobal vector control response 2017–2030[16], which is outlined in the subsequent section. Between 2000 and 2015, the infection prevalence ofPlasmodium falciparumin endemic Africa was halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40%[17]. Malaria control interventions averted an estimated 663 million (credible interval (CI) 542–753 million) clinical cases in Africa, with ITNs making the largest contribution (68% of cases averted). Indoor residual spraying (IRS) contributed an estimated 13% (11–16%), with a larger proportional contribution where intervention coverage was high[17]. Global vector control response 2017–2030 The vision of WHO and the broader infectious diseases community is a world free of human suffering from vector-borne diseases. In 2017, the World Health Assembly welcomed theGlobal vector control response 2017–2030[16](GVCR) and adopted a resolution to promote an integrated approach to the control of vector-borne diseases. The approach builds on the concept of integrated vector management (IVM), but with renewed focus on improved human capacity, strengthened infrastructure and systems, improved surveillance, and better coordination and integrated action across sectors and diseases. Development programmes, including, for example, irrigated agriculture, hydroelectric dam construction, road building, forest clearance, housing development and industrial expansion, all have the potential to influence vector-borne diseases, offering the opportunity for intersectoral collaboration and the adoption of strategies other than those based on insecticides. The ultimate aim of the GVCR is to reduce the burden and threat of vector-borne diseases through effective, locally adapted, sustainable vector control in full alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 3.3: to end epidemics of malaria by 2030. Effective and sustainable vector control is achievable only with sufficient human resources, an enabling infrastructure and a functional health system. As recommended under the GVCR, national programmes should lead a vector control needs assessment across the relevant sectors[18]to help appraise current capacity, define the requisite capacity to conduct proposed activities, identify opportunities for improved efficiency in vector control delivery, and guide resource mobilization to implement the national strategic plan. 37 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Prevention, mitigation and management of insecticide resistance Widespread and increasing insecticide resistance poses a threat to effective malaria vector control.

Failure to mitigate and manage insecticide resistance is likely to result in an increased burden of disease, potentially reversing some of the substantial gains made in controlling malaria over the last decade. WHO maintains aglobal insecticide resistance databaseand an online mapping tool that consolidate information on the status of the insecticide susceptibility ofAnophelesmosquitoes in malaria-endemic countries. The latest data reveal that almost 90% of the malaria- endemic countries reporting insecticide resistance have detected resistance of their vectors to at least one insecticide class. Globally, resistance to pyrethroids is widespread, having been detected in at least one malaria vector in 68% of the sites for which data were available. Resistance to organochlorines was reported in 64% of the public sites. Resistance to carbamates and organophosphates was less prevalent, detected in 34% and 28% of the sites that reported monitoring data, respectively[3]. To date, there is no evidence of operational failure of vector control programmes as a direct result of increasing frequency of pyrethroid resistance[19][20].Based on past experience, however, it is likely that operational failure will eventually occur if effective insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategies are not designed and implemented. Ideally, such strategies should be implemented early to prevent the spread and increase in the intensity of resistance. The overarching concepts of such resistance management strategies were outlined in theGlobal plan for insecticide resistance management in malaria vectors(GPIRM) in 2012[21]. Guidance on monitoring of insecticide resistance, interpretation of test results and implications for decision-making are given in the WHOManual for monitoring insecticide resistance in mosquito vectors and selecting appropriate interventions[22]and in the Framework for a national plan for monitoring and the management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors[23]. When deciding whether adjustments to the national malaria strategic plan are required in a given area, at least the following must be considered for that locality: - current and past transmission levels; - current and past interventions deployed, including the coverage, usage and duration of efficacy; - the insecticide resistance profile of the main vector species (including resistance intensity and resistance mechanisms); and - other entomological information including vector species distribution, abundance and other bionomic data. The susceptibility of mosquitoes to insecticides and determination of the species-specific presence, intensity and mechanisms of resistance in vector populations can be used to guide the selection of the most appropriate insecticidal products to deploy. Generally, if mosquitoes are found to be resistant to an insecticide, insecticides with a different mode of action should be deployed. However, there are reports of mosquitoes having differential susceptibility to insecticides within the same class, and questions have been raised about the level of cross-resistance between pyrethroid products[21].

Based on a review of evidence from molecular, laboratory and field data, the authors concluded that differences between adult mosquito mortalities in pyrethroid insecticide resistance assays are not indicative of a true or operationally relevant difference in the potential performance of pyrethroids currently in common use (deltamethrin, permethrin, α-cypermethrin and λ-cyhalothrin). Consequently, switching between pyrethroid insecticides (to improve intervention efficacy) should not be used as a means of managing insecticide resistance. This finding supports WHO’s past and present position. Given that pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes is widespread, WHO encourages the development and continued evaluation of nets treated with alternative insecticides[25]. Key technical principles for addressing insecticide resistance are as follows: - Insecticides should be deployed with care and deliberation in order to reduce unnecessary selection pressure and maximize their impact on disease. National malaria programmes (NMPs) should consider whether they are using insecticides judiciously, carefully and with discrimination, and if there is a clear epidemiological benefit. - Vector control programmes should avoid using a single class of insecticide everywhere and over consecutive years. Whenever possible, vector control programmes should diversify insecticide use, to preserve the effectiveness of each individual insecticide class. Although pyrethroids may continue to be used for ITNs in the near term, they should not generally be deployed for IRS in areas with pyrethroid ITNs, whether alone, or in combination with insecticides from a different class. - IRM principles and methods should be incorporated into all vector control programmes, not as an option, but as a core component of an IVM programme. - Strengthening coordination and collaboration among key sectors, such as the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of the Interior and local administration, is crucial for the effective implementation of NMPs. This collaboration can help to ensure a comprehensive strategy for managing insecticide use and addressing resistance issues by adopting the One Health approach.

Where feasible, a formal economic evaluation is encouraged/ recommended to investigate the likely incremental costs and effectiveness of potential approaches, relative to feasible alternatives, for a given context. Approaches Historically, the most common way insecticides have been deployed to control malaria vectors has been through “sequential use”. In essence, this is when a single insecticide class is used continuously or repeatedly until resistance has rendered it less effective or ineffective, after which a switch is made to an insecticide with a different mode of action to which there is no (or less) resistance. In theory, this may allow for an eventual switch back to the original insecticide class if resistance decreases to the point that it is no longer detectable by means of bioassays. The agricultural industry has had some success in managing resistance by using different insecticides over space and time. Similar approaches have been proposed with the aim of preventing or delaying the spread and increase of resistance by removing selection pressure or by killing resistant mosquitoes. These strategies include mixtures of insecticides, mosaic spraying, rotations of insecticides and deployment of multiple interventions in combination. - Mixtures are co-formulations that combine two or more insecticides with different modes of action. Effective deployment of a mixture requires the presence of resistance to all insecticides in the mixture to be rare, so that any individual mosquito that survives exposure to one insecticide is highly likely to be killed by the other insecticide or insecticides. Ideally, all insecticides in a mixture should have a similar residual life and remain bioavailable over time; in practice, this is difficult to achieve, particularly for vector control products that are meant to last for a number of years, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs).

The theory is that resistance frequencies will decline (or at least not increase) during the period of non-deployment of insecticides with a specific mode of action. - Mosaics involve the deployment of insecticides with different modes of action in neighbouring geographical areas. The optimal spatial scale (size of areas) for mosaics has yet to be determined, and rotations are generally considered to be more practical and feasible. - Combinations expose the vector population to two classes of insecticides with differing modes of action through the co- deployment of different interventions in the same place, such as ITNs co-deployed with non-pyrethroid IRS (where both are at high coverage; see recommendation under section 4.1.2). For malaria vector control, however, there is still little evidence of the success of these strategies and no consensus on the best IRM approach or approaches to apply in a given situation. Success of a particular approach will likely depend on mosquito genetics, behaviour and population dynamics, and the chemical nature of the insecticides and their formulation. A 2013 review of experimental and modelling studies on insecticide, pesticide and drug resistance concluded that mixtures generally lead to the slowest evolution of resistance[26]. However, more recently, an exploration of overlaps between agriculture and public health found that – owing to caveats and case specificity – there is only weak evidence of one IRM approach being better than another, and that the standard practice of using insecticides until resistance emerges before switching to an alternative (i.e. sequential use) may be equally effective under certain circumstances. More data, both from research and programmatic operations, are needed to compare resistance management approaches in the field[27]and to improve understanding of the biological mechanisms that are likely to favour different approaches in different situations[28][29]. Evidence-based planning To achieve optimal impact against malaria, control measures must be suitable for the geographic area (based on vector bionomics) and, well targeted and deployed at sufficient coverage. Without an evidence base or sufficient capacity to deploy interventions appropriately, resources may be used suboptimally. Given the heavy reliance on insecticidal interventions – primarily ITNs and IRS – the impacts on the environment and insecticide resistance of local vectors are key considerations in vector control planning and implementation. The inappropriate deployment of insecticides both in agriculture and in public health programmes has the potential to result in avoidable insecticide contamination of the environment and/or development of insecticide resistance of local vectors.

A pragmatic approach must be taken that seeks to select appropriate vector control interventions based on the insecticide resistance profile of the major malaria vectors in the target area. To outline how resistance will be monitored and managed, NMPs should develop and implement national plans in accordance with the WHOFramework for a national plan for monitoring and management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors[23]. Detailed information on insecticide resistance monitoring methods and on how to use the data to inform the selection of appropriate interventions is provided in the revised WHOManual for monitoring insecticide resistance in mosquito vectors and selecting appropriate interventions[22]. Further information on insecticide resistance monitoring and, more broadly, on entomological surveillance is included in the WHOMalaria surveillance, monitoring & evaluation: a reference manual, which outlines priority data across different transmission settings[30]. IRM plans should be revisited regularly to consider new information, and to integrate new interventions once they have been supported by WHO recommendations and prequalified. Vector control across different malaria transmission settings Access to effective vector control interventions will need to be maintained in the majority of countries and locations where malaria control has been effective. This includes settings with ongoing malaria transmission, as well as those in which transmission has been interrupted but in which some level of receptivity[31]and vulnerability remains. Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of local transmission (reduction to zero incidence of indigenous cases) of a specified malaria parasite species in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate intervention activities. Following elimination, continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are usually required[30].Interventions are no longer required once eradication has been achieved. Malaria eradication is defined as the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by all human malaria parasite species as a result of deliberate activities. Residual transmission WHO acknowledges that malaria can persist despite high coverage of antimalarial interventions,including in areas with optimal access to and use of ITNs or with high IRS coverage[32]. Thispersistence of malaria transmission following the implementation in time and space of a widely effective malaria programme is referred to as residual transmission.Residual transmission occurs as a result of a combination of human and vector behaviours, for example, when people reside in or visit forest areas or do not sleep in protected houses, or when local mosquito vector species exhibit one or more behaviours that enable them to avoid vector control interventions, such as biting outside early in the evening before people have retired indoors and/or resting outdoors.The sources and risk of residual transmission may, therefore, vary by location,", "page_start": 40, "page_end": 40, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

In some settings, supplementary interventions may be used in addition to ITNs or IRS to further reduce transmission. Recommendations on larviciding with chemical or biological insecticides and the use of house screening are outlined in a subsequent chapter. Supplementary interventions should be implemented in accordance with the principles outlined in theGlobal vector control response 2017–2030[16]. Residual transmission can be difficult to measure, as is the specific impact of supplementary tools on this component of ongoing transmission. Standardized methods for quantifying and characterizing this component of transmission are required in order to evaluate the effectiveness of single or combined interventions in addressing this biological challenge to malaria prevention, control and elimination. There is an urgent need for greatly improved knowledge of the bionomics of the mosquitoes responsible for maintaining local transmission. New interventions and strategies should be evaluated against these vectors in order to effectively address residual transmission. While this knowledge is being gained and interventions are being developed, NMPs must prioritize the effective implementation of current interventions to reduce transmission to the lowest level possible. At the same time, they should collaborate with academic or research institutions to generate local evidence on the magnitude of the problem of residual transmission of malaria, including information on human and vector behaviours, and the effectiveness of existing and novel interventions. Acceptability, participation and ethical considerations Community participation in the implementation of vector control interventions often takes the form of “instruction” or “information”, with decisions about the need for interventions being made at international and national levels. Taking into account communities’ views on the recommended interventions may promote acceptance and adherence to the intervention. Increased levels of participation (e.g. consultation, inclusion and shared decision-making) should be included in the development and deployment of vector control interventions – from inception through to the planning and implementation stages. WHO acknowledges that appropriate policy-making often requires explicit consideration of ethical matters in addition to scientific evidence. However, the ethical issues relevant to vector-borne disease control and research have not received the analysis necessary to further improve public health programmes. Moreover, WHO Member States lack specific guidance in this area. The Seventieth World Health Assembly[33]requested the Director-General “to review and provide technical guidance on the ethical aspects and issues associated with the implementation of new vector control approaches in order to develop mitigating strategies and solutions; and to undertake a review of the ethical aspects and related issues associated with vector control implementation that include social 40 of", "page_start": 40, "page_end": 40, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Unique ethical issues associated with vector control that were identified include the ethics of coercive or mandated vector control, the deployment of insecticides (and growing vector resistance to insecticides), and research on and/or deployment of new vector control technologies. Genetically modified mosquitoes are one such innovation that presents potential challenges, including how to prevent their spread beyond the intended geographical target areas and limit potential effects on the local fauna. In 2020 WHO published guidance on vector-borne disease and ethical considerations[35]. Work is continuing to develop guidance in this area. Equity, gender and human rights WHO advocates for optimal coverage with recommended vector control interventions. As such, malaria vector control should be implemented without discrimination on the basis of age, sex, ethnicity, religion or other characteristics. In some cases, special effort is required to reach populations that are geographically isolated or adopt a nomadic lifestyle. Resource implications and prioritization In the Guidelines, resource implications and the cost-effectiveness of vector control interventions have been largely addressed by drawing on a recent systematic review of the cost and cost-effectiveness of vector control interventions[36]and expert opinion within the GDG. The systematic review of the cost and cost-effectiveness of vector control interventions that was used to inform the current vector control guidelines was published in 2021, as part of a broader systematic review on the cost and cost-effectiveness of malaria control interventions, drawing on evidence published between 2005 and 2018[36]. The body of evidence on vector control interventions was based on the use of ITNs/LLINs, IRS and larval source management (LSM) mostly in sub-Saharan African countries. The review reported that, overall, WHO-recommended malaria interventions including vector control represent value for money; however, there was great variation in the costs of intervention delivery, reflecting not onlydifferences in the actual resource use, but also the various types of costing methodologies employed. The available cost and cost-effectiveness data focused largely on individual interventions and less so on packages of interventions, which are recommended for effective malaria control.

The WHO Global Malaria Programme is working with partners to update the evidence review on the cost and cost-effectiveness of the vector control interventions covered in the Guidelinesto support future Guideline development deliberations, for example, by building and updating a database for the cost and cost-effectiveness of vector control and other malaria interventions. It is also planned that systematic reviews commissioned in the future will include a search of the literature on both the cost and cost-effectiveness of interventions under consideration as well as those previously approved. 4.1.1 Interventions recommended for large-scale deployment Interventions that are recommended for large-scale deployment in terms of malaria vector control are those thathave proven protective efficacy to reduce or prevent infection and/or disease in humans and are broadly applicable for populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings. Vector control interventions applicable for all populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings are: i) deployment of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) that are prequalified by WHO, and ii) indoor residual spraying (IRS) with a product prequalified by WHO. Between 2000 and 2015, 78% of the clinical malaria cases averted was attributed to insecticidal vector control, namely through the widespread scale-up of ITNs and IRS[17]. Programmatic targets against malaria, as detailed within national strategic plans, should be used to guide the decision-making process to assemble context-appropriate intervention packages. Decision-making around the intervention mix to deploy and the coverage level of each intervention needs to consider available local data to guide the stratification of interventions, the available funding, the relative cost-effectiveness of available intervention options, the resources required to provide access within the broader context of universal health coverage (UHC), the feasibility of deploying the intervention(s) at the desired coverage level, and the country's strategic goal. The optimal coverage of the components of an intervention package for a given geographical area will also depend on other site-specific factors such as past and present transmission intensity, past and present intervention coverage, acceptability, and equity of access/use. For malaria vector control interventions recommended for large-scale deployment namely, ITNs and IRS, optimal coverage refers to providing populations at risk of malaria with access to ITNs coupled with health promotion to maximize use, and ensuring timely replacement; or providing these populations with regular application of IRS. Either intervention should be deployed at a level that provides the best value for money while reflecting programmatic realities. 41 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Insecticide-treated nets For the ITN classes covered by WHO recommendations as interventions for use in protecting populations at risk of malaria, including", "page_start": 41, "page_end": 42, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

WHO Member States and their procurement partners are encouraged to draw on the list of prequalified products to inform their choice of product(s). An ITN may repel, disable and/or impact the fecundity of mosquitoes that come into contact with the insecticide on the netting material in addition to providing a physical barrier, thereby protecting the individual user. In addition, some studies have indicated that ITNs produce a “community effect”, which means that when enough ITNs are being used in a community, the survival of the mosquito population as a whole is affected; this effect increases the protection against malaria for ITN users and extends protection to members of the community who do not sleep under an ITN[37][38][39][40][41]. However, such a community effect has not been observed in all settings[42][43][44]. The WHO Global Malaria Programme commissioned a review to examine the evidence for a community effect and to investigate the biological mechanisms by which ITNs provide both personal- and community-level protection against malaria. The review also investigated what factors may determine the presence of a community effect and moderate its intensity (Lineset alunpublished evidence). The review concluded that a community effect does occur in most settings, and that its extent is driven by a number of contextual factors. These factors include vector behaviour (particularly the extent of anthropophily, i.e. the propensity to feed on people, and endophagy, i.e. the tendency of mosquitoes to blood-feed indoors); the relative availability of human and non-human hosts in the locality; the level of ITN coverage and use in a community; the insecticide used (its residual insecticidal activity and repellency); and the resistance of the local malaria vectors, both physiological and behavioural, to the insecticide on the net. The ITN coverage threshold for when the community effect becomes apparent depends on a large number of contextual factors. Regardless of the context-dependent starting threshold, the extent of the community-level protection increases as ITN coverage and net use in a given community increases. Because ITNs kill insecticide-susceptible mosquitoes that come into contact with the insecticide on the netting material, more mosquitoes will be killed as ITN coverage increases. This killing effect reduces both mosquito population density and mosquito longevity, resulting in fewer malaria vectors overall and a lower infectivity rate as fewer mosquitoes will survive the time it takes for the malaria parasite to develop in the mosquito. Consequently, the reduced density, age and proportion of", "page_start": 42, "page_end": 42, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

This killing effect reduces both mosquito population density and mosquito longevity, resulting in fewer malaria vectors overall and a lower infectivity rate as fewer mosquitoes will survive the time it takes for the malaria parasite to develop in the mosquito. Consequently, the reduced density, age and proportion of the local mosquito population that is infective offer an additional level of protection to the whole community beyond the individual protection provided by ITNs. Large-scale field trials[41][45]and transmission models[46][47]originally suggested that community coverage (i.e. the proportion of human population using an ITN with effective insecticide treatments each night) of ≥ 50% is expected to result in some level of community-wide protection. The WHO-commissioned review indicated that this area-wide protection may start to occur at lower coverage levels (Lineset alunpublished evidence). The review modelled the short-term effect of increasing ITN coverage on the EIR (infectious bites per person per year) in an area with high malaria transmission and an insecticide-susceptible, anthropophilic vector, assuming fixed human infectiousness. In the coverage range of 15% to 85%, an additional 20% increase in coverage of the human population at risk would result in a reduction in malaria transmission intensity of approximately 50% (these findings are taken from the report submitted to WHO; findings may be revised if indicated by peer review). Additional ITN coverage is always beneficial in terms of providing more protection to individuals – both users and non-users of ITNs – and, conversely, any reduction in coverage may result in increased malaria transmission. However, there may be diminishing marginal returns to increasing coverage at higher levels. In terms of absolute cases of malaria averted, a reduction in malaria transmission when increasing ITN coverage from 80% to 100% may not generate the same impact as a 20% increase in coverage at lower levels of coverage; the marginal costs required to increase coverage at high levels (>80%) will also increase due to growing system inefficiencies. Atthe country level, these diminishing returns must be balanced against potential investments in other cost-effective malaria prevention and control activities by means of a well-informed prioritization process. Three main ITN classes are recognized by WHO. With the March 2023 update to the guidelines, these classes are: - ITNs designed to kill host-seeking insecticide-susceptible mosquito populations that have demonstrated publichealth value compared to untreated nets and whose entomological effects consist of killing and reducing the blood-feeding of insecticide- susceptible mosquito vectors. This intervention class covers pyrethroid-only nets prequalified by WHOand conventionally treated nets that rely on periodic re-treatment with a WHO prequalified self-treatment kit. Public health value has been demonstrated for products within this class and WHO recommends use of pyrethroid-only LLINs prequalified by WHO for large-scale deployment. - ITNs designed to kill host-seeking insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and for which a first-in-class product demonstrates public health value compared to the epidemiological impact", "page_start": 42, "page_end": 42, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

This class includes nets that are treated with a pyrethroid insecticide and a synergist such as piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and nets treated with insecticides other than pyrethroid-based formulations. Public health value has been demonstrated for this class and WHO has issued recommendations for deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets and for pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets in areas with pyrethroid- resistant mosquitoes. 42 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - ITNs designed to sterilize and/or reduce the fecundity of host-seeking insecticide-resistant mosquitoes for which a first-in- class product demonstrates public health value compared to the epidemiological impact of pyrethroid-only nets. Nets treated with pyrethroid + pyriproxyfen (an insect growth regulator), which fall into this class, are now conditionally recommended for deployment instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs. ITNs are most effective where the principal malaria vector(s) mosquitoes bite predominantly at night after people have retired under their nets. ITNs can be used both indoors and outdoors, wherever they can be suitably hung (although hanging nets in direct sunlight should be avoided, as sunlight can affect insecticidal activity). Residual surface treatment Residual surface treatment (RST) is the application of insecticides with residual activity to surfaces where malaria mosquito vectors may rest such as walls and ceilings,withtheaimofkillingthemosquitoesthat potentiallytransmit malaria. RST conceptually includes indoor and outdoor applications and may be delivered through several approaches, such as spraying, applying insecticidal paints or installing wall linings. It can be applied to all surfaces or to select areas where mosquitoes are more likely to rest. IRS is a procedure commonly used in many malaria programmes for malaria control. ITNs and IRS interventions have been credited for the large reductions in malaria seen globally between 2000 and 2015[17]. IRS involves the spraying of internal walls, eaves and ceilings of structures (including domestic animal shelters), where resting malaria vectors are likely to come into contact with the insecticide. Indoor residual surface treatment (IRST) captures the current use pattern of IRS for malaria vector control and could potentially include other application methods as detailed above.

IRS is most effective where the vector population is susceptible to the insecticide(s) being applied, where the majority of mosquitoes feed and rest indoors, and where most structures are suitable for spraying. When deciding whether to deploy IRS, programmes should assess these variables and consider whether achieving the target coverage of IRS is feasible. Humanitarian emergencies The first priorities for malaria control in humanitarian emergencies are prompt and effective diagnosis and treatment[48]. While deployment of ITNs and IRS has been shown to provide protection against malaria in the limited number of studies that have been carried out in the chronic phase of emergencies[49][50][51][52][53][54][55](Messengeret alunpublished evidence), it should be recognized that deployment of such interventions may be logistically challenging during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency. In the following sections, recommendations regarding the deployment of ITNs and IRSare provided. Some vector control interventions and personal protection measures have been developed specifically for deployment in emergency situations. Such interventions include insecticide-treated plastic sheeting (ITPS) or tarpaulins, which can be used to construct temporary shelters, and insecticide-impregnated blankets or topsheets, used to protect people sleeping at night. Such items may be included in emergency relief kits provided at the outset of an emergency. Additionally, the use of repellents and treating peridomestic animals (such as cattle) with insecticides could support efforts to protect the population. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions in humanitarian emergencies[55](Messengeret al unpublished evidence), so the evidence base on their effectiveness against malaria is currently insufficient to formulate recommendations. In humanitarian emergencies, further consideration must be given to whether the delivery of vector control interventions is feasible. This may depend on: - thetypeofshelteravailable(e.g.adhocrefusematerials, plastic sheeting, tents, more permanent housing) - theavailableinfrastructure,resourcesandhumancapacity to deliver vector control; and - engaging with community leaders and educating the population about the benefits of vector control, to enhance acceptance and cooperation. 43 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Strong recommendation for , High certainty evidence Pyrethroid-only nets (2019) Pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults living in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. - WHO recommends ITNs that have beenprequalifiedby WHO for deployment in protecting populations at risk of malaria. - ITNs are most effective where the principal malaria vector(s) bite predominantly at night after people have retired under their nets. - ITNs can be used both indoors and outdoors, wherever they can be suitably hung (though hanging nets in direct sunlight should be avoided, as sunlight can affect insecticidal activity).

Practical info The current WHO recommendation for ITNs applies only to those mosquito nets that have beenprequalifiedby WHO and that contain only an insecticide of the pyrethroid class(categorized as ‘pyrethroid-only LLINs’). As with all insecticide-based interventions, the insecticide resistance profile of the vectors within the area of deployment should be assessed. If pyrethroid-resistance is detected, pyrethroid-PBO ITN or pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs should be considered for distribution, and pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs may be considered, instead of pyrethroid-only nets (see the following recommendations on the other types of nets). ITNs are generally acceptable to most communities. In many malaria-endemic countries, untreated nets were in use for many years prior to the introduction of ITNs and, even where there is not a long history of their use, they have become familiar tools for preventing mosquito bites. Individuals often appreciate the extra privacy afforded by a net, as well as its effectiveness in controlling other nuisance insects. In very hot climates, ITNs may be less acceptable, as they are perceived to reduce air flow, making it too hot to allow for a comfortable sleep. In areas where mosquito densities are low or where malaria transmission is low, individuals and communities may perceive less benefit to using nets. When deploying ITNs, coverage must be optimized such that both personal and community-level effects are maximized and maintained in endemic settings. Post-distribution monitoring of nets is essential, reporting their durability, usage and coverage. Evaluation of the impact on vectors, such as their abundance, EIR and behaviour, and insecticide resistance status can be used to inform and guide future deployment. Nets should be handled and disposed of appropriately to minimize risk to human and animal health and of environmental contamination. WHO recommends that old nets are not burned in the open air but are buried, preferably in non-permeable soil and away from water sources. Burning may lead to the release of dioxins, which are harmful to human health. The insecticides used on nets are toxic to aquatic organisms and so should not be disposed of in water. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review[56]reported that, compared to no nets, ITNs significantly reduce: - all-cause child mortality (rate ratio: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77–0.89; high-certainty evidence) - incidence of P. falciparum malaria (rate ratio: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.48–0.64; high-certainty evidence) - prevalence of P. falciparum malaria (risk ratio: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71–0.98; high-certainty evidence), and - incidence of severe malaria disease (rate ratio: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38–0.82; high-certainty evidence).

The GDG drew on the analysis to make recommendations related to ITNs only. The systematic reviewreported high-certainty evidence that, compared to no nets, ITNs are effective at reducing the rate of all- cause child mortality, the rate of uncomplicated episodes ofP. falciparum, the incidence rate of severe malaria episodes, and the prevalence ofP. falciparum. ITNs may also reduce the prevalence ofP. vivax, but here the evidence of an effect was less certain. Compared to untreated nets, there was high certainty evidence that ITNs reduce the rate of uncomplicated episodes ofP. falciparumand reduce the prevalence ofP. falciparum. There was moderate certainty evidence that ITNs also reduce all-cause child mortality compared to untreated nets. The effects on the incidence of uncomplicatedP. vivaxepisodes andP. vivax prevalence were less clear. The systematic review did not identify any undesirable effects of pyrethroid ITNs. Research needs - Determine the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection), as well as potential harms and/or unintended consequences of new types of nets and insecticides in areas where resistance to pyrethroids is high. - Determine the durability of different pyrethroid-only nets over the replenishment cycle of ITNs in field settings (generally three years or more). - Determine the effectiveness of nets in situations of residual/outdoor transmission. - Determine the impact of ITNs in transmission ‘hotspots’ and elimination settings.

The conditionality of this recommendation is driven by the current higher unit cost of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid- only LLINs and therefore the uncertainty of their affordability in different settings. Furthermore, asPBO is less wash-resistant than pyrethroids, its bioavailability declines faster over the three-year estimated life of an ITN; therefore, the added impact of pyrethroid- PBO ITNs over that of pyrethroid-only LLINs may decline over time. The evidence comes from two sites in eastern Africa with pyrethroid resistance and not from other geographies where transmission levels and vector characteristics may vary. PBO acts by inhibiting certain metabolic enzymes, primarily oxidases, and so are likely to provide greater protection than pyrethroid-only LLINs where mosquitoes display mono-oxygenase-based insecticide resistance mechanisms. In deciding whether pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may be appropriate in their context, malaria programmes should: - consider the deployment of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in areas where resistance to pyrethroids in local vectors has been detected; - determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra cost of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, while ensuring that coverage of populations at risk of malaria is not affected; - note that WHO recommends that ITNsprequalifiedby WHO be selected for deployment. Practical info Given that the evidence indicates that unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs are more effective than pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas with pyrethroid resistance up to 25 months post-deployment, the decision on whether to switch from pyrethroid-only LLINs to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, or another ITN product designed to provide enhanced efficacy in areas of pyrethroid resistance, should be guided by resource availability. WHO recommends that pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs be used where pyrethroid resistance is confirmed 46 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) using standard procedures[22]. Given that pyrethroid‐PBO nets are designed to provide improved impact against resistant mosquitoes in which pyrethroid resistance is, at least in part, conferred by a monooxygenase-based resistance mechanism, determining the presence of such resistance mechanisms in local vector populations will provide additional information to help target deployment. In deciding whether to use potentially more expensive pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, malaria programmes should consider the impact this switch may have on vector control coverage. Deployment of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs must only be considered in situations where coverage with effective vector control (primarily ITNs or IRS) will not be reduced. The primary goal must be to ensure continued access and use of ITNs or IRS at levels that ensure optimal coverage for all people at risk of malaria as part of an intervention package. Post-distribution monitoring of nets to estimate coverage in terms of access to and use of nets and other malaria interventions is recommended.

Post-distribution monitoring of nets to estimate coverage in terms of access to and use of nets and other malaria interventions is recommended. Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs should not be considered a tool that can alone effectively manage insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. Despite the recent recommendation of other ITN classes and associate product, the development and evaluation of ITNs treated with non-pyrethroid insecticides and other innovative vector control interventions for deployment across all settings continues to remain a priority to provide alternatives for use in a comprehensive IRM strategy. The systematic review reported that the washing of pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs may result in lower mosquito mortality and higher blood- feeding success than the washing of pyrethroid-only LLINs.The durability ofpyrethroid‐PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINshas been questioned previously based on wash-resistance data. The added epidemiological and entomological impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs depends on the bioavailability and retention of PBO on/in the net. If this is reduced significantly over time and/or declines with washing, the greater impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over pyrethroid-only LLINs in terms of protection against malaria may be limited to less than three years. As part of M&E activities, data collected by programmes on net durability would provide information on the life span of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs under field conditions and hence on the period over which the additional impact is maintained. Programmes that decide to switch from pyrethroid-only LLINs to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs based on concerns regarding continued effectiveness and/or insecticide resistance status of local vectors, should not revert back to the use of pyrethroid-only LLINs thereafter. Instead, programmes should plan for continued deployment of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in that geographic area or develop plans for deployment of other equally or more effective new interventions once these are covered by a WHO recommendation. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review[57]included two trials[58][59]from the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Uganda that compared the epidemiological impact of pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs against malaria to that of pyrethroid-only LLINs. Both trials were conducted in areas with highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes, defined by the review team as mosquitoes demonstrating <30% mortality in discriminating dose assays. The review provided high- to moderate-certainty evidence that malaria parasite prevalence was lower where pyrethroid-PBO nets were deployed at four time points post net distribution, being: - 4–6 months: OR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.62–0.89), - 9–12 months:OR:0.72 (95%CI:0.61–0.86), - 16–18months:OR:0.88(95%CI:0.74–1.04),and - 21–25 months:OR:0.79 (95%CI:0.67–0.95). The review also reported entomological outcomes, mosquito mortality and mosquito blood-feeding success derived from experimental hut studies. In areas classified by the authors as having highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes, unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs were found to result in higher mosquito mortality and lower blood-feeding success compared to unwashed pyrethroid-only LLINs.

Comparing washed pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs to washed pyrethroid-only LLINs, however, the review reported that it was unclear whether the washed pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs had a greater effect on mosquito mortality, although the washed pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs did decrease the blood‐feeding success of mosquitoes. In areas defined as having moderate, low (defined by the review team as 31–60% and 61–90% mosquito mortality, respectively, in discriminating dose assays) or no pyrethroid insecticide resistance, the review did not identify any studies with epidemiological outcomes. Regarding entomological outcomes, mosquito mortality was only shown to be higher with unwashedpyrethroid‐PBO ITNs compared to unwashed pyrethroid-only LLINs in those areas with moderate insecticide resistance. Little or no difference was seen in terms of mosquito mortality orblood‐feeding rates when washed or unwashedpyrethroid‐PBO ITNs were usedin areas with low or no resistance compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs. 47 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Given that the systematic review was limited to two studies with malaria outcomes, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined. However, as with pyrethroid-only LLINs, the GDG concluded that the extent of the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs is likely to vary in different settings and will depend on a number of factors, such as the behaviour of the main malaria vectors and their level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance, the parasite prevalence in that area, and the usage of nets within a community. The systematic review did not report any harms or unintended consequences of the intervention. However, the GDG noted that, compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may play an as yet unknown role in the development of insecticide resistance inAnophelesmosquito vectors, such as increasing selection pressure for non-oxygenase resistance mechanisms or perhaps increasing the intensity of oxygenase resistance. In the absence of empirical evidence, this potential undesirable effect was judged to be small.

Based on the available cost data, the GDG judged that there are currently additional costs associated with deploying pyrethroid‐PBO and other types of ITNs over pyrethroid-only LLINs.

Based on the available cost data, the GDG judged that there are currently additional costs associated with deploying pyrethroid‐PBO and other types of ITNs over pyrethroid-only LLINs. Due to the likely scale of ITN deployment, any additional cost per net would amount to a considerable additional budget associated with a switch away from pyrethroid-only LLINs, which would need to be met in order to maintain coverage. The GDG, however, remarked that unit costs change over time and, as they do, a review will be needed to determine whether this cost discrepancy remains. National programmes are encouraged to pay specific attention to the commodity cost, as this will also vary depending on required quantities and lead-times and will be a key ingredient to the separately developed guidance on ITN prioritization. Apart from the higher cost of the net, the GDG identified no additional resource requirements associated with a switch from pyrethroid-only LLINs to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Based on experience to date, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs require similar resources to those identified for the distribution of pyrethroid-only LLINs (see table provided under “Resources and other considerations” for pyrethroid-only LLINs). It would be necessary to assess the insecticide resistance status in the principal vector(s) in the area where deployment is planned in order to determine whether pyrethroid resistance is present and thus to justify such deployment. However, regular insecticide resistance testing by means of bioassays should form part of routine programme monitoring operations and therefore should already be part of the budget. Further information justifying the use of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs could be generated using standard WHO procedures[22]to determine if a monooxygenase-based mechanism is at least partially involved in conferring pyrethroid resistance. The systematic review reported thatcost‐effectiveness analyses comparing pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs andpyrethroid-only LLINs are currently not available[57]. The GDG concluded that the cost- effectiveness of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs may vary. In areas of pyrethroid resistance, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may have greater impact on malaria than pyrethroid-only LLINs during the period for which the PBO is bioavailable. However, PBO is less wash-resistant than pyrethroids and its bioavailability therefore declines faster over the three-year estimated life of an ITN. The added impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over that of pyrethroid-only LLINs may be lost or decline considerably over time. 48 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) In addition to the issue of durability, the cost-effectiveness may also depend on a number of potential effect modifiers, such as the malaria transmission level and vector characteristics in an area. Lastly, the GDG was concerned that, given flatlined funding for malaria[3], the procurement of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may negatively impact programmes’ ability to maintain ITN coverage of at-risk populations.

Lastly, the GDG was concerned that, given flatlined funding for malaria[3], the procurement of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may negatively impact programmes’ ability to maintain ITN coverage of at-risk populations. Due to the current moderately higher cost of this commodity, there is a risk that existing net coverage could not be maintained if no additional funds were made available to cover the additional expenditure required to purchase the same quantity of nets as previously deployed. Equity The impact on the equity of using pyrethroid-PBO ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs was judged to vary by the GDG. If switching to more costly pyrethroid-PBO ITNs resulted in lower coverage of those at risk of contracting malaria with preventive tools, equity would likely be reduced. However, if the switch resulted in no reduction in coverage and those populations who were previously provided with pyrethroid- only LLINs were then protected against malaria by a slightly more effective intervention, equity would likely increase. Acceptability No research was identified regarding the acceptability of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. However, the GDG judged that such nets would be equally acceptable to key stakeholders, given that they are by-and-large physically the same as and used similarly to pyrethroid-only LLINs. Feasibility No research was identified regarding the feasibility of implementing pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Nevertheless, the GDG judged that distributing such nets would be equally feasible as for pyrethroid-only LLINs. Justification Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs combine pyrethroids and a synergist, which acts by inhibiting certain metabolic enzymes, primarily oxidases, within the mosquito that would otherwise detoxify or sequester insecticides before they could reach their target site in an insect. Therefore, compared to a pyrethroid-only LLIN, a pyrethroid-PBO ITNs should have an increased killing effect on malaria vectors that express elevated oxidases, which is commonly associated with pyrethroid resistance. The systematic review[57]identified and included two trials[58][59], both from eastern Africa, evaluating parasite prevalence in areas where pyrethroid-PBO ITNs were deployed compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs. Both trials were conducted in areas with highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes, defined by the review team as mosquitoes demonstrating <30% mortality in discriminating dose assays. Parasite prevalence was reduced by approximately 20% up to 25 months after distribution. The Tanzanian trial has been extended further to establish whether this effect lasts the full duration of an LLIN's intended lifespan, but results are not yet publicly available. Although the two epidemiological trials included in the review were from areas where pyrethroid resistance was determined to be high, the methods used by the authors to determine the level of resistance and the categorization of the different bands of resistance intensity were not consistent with those recommended by WHO[22]. In many parts of Africa, as well as other parts of the world, pyrethroid resistance is becoming more prevalent and is generally increasing in intensity in the presence of continued selection pressure[3].

The panel therefore concluded thatpyrethroid-PBO ITNs are likely to offer greater protection against malaria than pyrethroid-only LLINs in most areas where pyrethroid resistance is detected and mediated by elevated oxidases, regardless of resistance intensity. When moving from the evidence provided to a decision on the strength of the recommendation, the GDG concluded that the recommendation should be conditional rather than strong for this intervention. In the context of guideline development, a conditional recommendation reflects that the GDG concludes that the desirable effects of adhering to the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, but the panel is not confident about these trade-offs. The conditionality of this recommendation was based on the fact that the available evidence was only from African sites with pyrethroid resistance, rather than from other geographies; the moderate additional benefit of deploying pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs; the overall moderate certainty of the results; the higher unit cost of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs; and the uncertainty of cost-effectiveness. Research needs WHO encourages additional high-quality research to generate further evidence on: - the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended 49 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) consequences of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in areas where the mechanisms of resistance in vector species are not oxidase-based and in areas of lower malaria transmission intensity; - contextual factors (e.g. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs; - the durability of different pyrethroid-PBO nets over the replenishment cycle of ITNs in field settings (generally three years or more). Strong recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs vs pyrethroid-only LLINs (2023) Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs should be deployed instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance. Note: Recommendations on deployment of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets were separated into two distinct recommendations for better clarity, but share the same evidence to decision, justification, practical info and research needs. Please refer to the following section.

The conditionality of the recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of desirable and undesirable effects probably favours pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs over pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. However, the evidence for this recommendation is from only one trial in Africa. In deciding whether to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, malaria programmes should: - determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra costs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, while ensuring optimal coverage of populations at risk of malaria; - generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g. stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as pyrethroid resistance mechanisms). ITNs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance; and - note that WHO recommends that ITNsprequalifiedby WHO be selected for deployment. Practical info Given that pyrethroid‐chlorfenapyr ITNs are designed to provide improved impact against insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, pyrethroid resistance in potential target areas should be confirmed using standard procedures[22], as should the susceptibility of local vectors to chlorfenapyr. In any case, pyrethroid‐chlorfenapyr ITNs should not be considered a tool that alone can effectively manage insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. As with all malaria interventions, post-distribution monitoring of ITNs to estimate coverage in terms of access to and use of ITNs is recommended. WHO also recommends that programmes conduct studies of ITN survival, which includes assessments of ITN 50 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) integrity, each time a campaign uses a new product such as pyrethroid‐chlorfenapyr ITNs. Such studies will provide information on the product’s life span under field conditions and thus enable estimation of the period over which the additional impact against malaria may be maintained. The systematic review reported that, two years after deployment, 34% of pyrethroid‐chlorfenapyr ITNs were torn (defined as hole area ≥ 790 cm2) and therefore not fit for use, compared to 28% of pyrethroid-only LLINs and 43% of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Given that the systematic review [Barkeret alunpublished evidence] was limited to two studies with malaria outcomes, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined. The GDG concluded that the extent of the impact of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs is likely to vary by setting and will depend on several factors such as intensity of malaria transmission, behaviour of the main malaria vectors, the level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance, and the usage of ITNs within a community.

The GDG also noted that both the type and dosage of pyrethroid on the pyrethroid-only LLINs and on pyrethroid- chlorfenapyr ITNs (alphacypermethrin) differed from those on the pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (permethrin), and this may influence the impact against malaria. Furthermore, the GDG observed that the resistance mechanism of the vector population at the study site was not reported. If the pyrethroid resistance in the study was not due to P450-based mechanisms, the effect of the pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may have been underestimated, as these nets would not have offered the same level of protection than in areas where resistance is conferred, at least partly, by P450-based mechanisms. The systematic review reported [Barkeret alunpublished evidence] that one trial[60]recorded 90 (44.1%) adverse events in the group assigned to the pyrethroid-only LLINs, 17 (8.5%) in the pyrethroid- chlorfenapyr ITN group and 17 (8.5%) in the pyrethroid-PBO ITN group. The authors also narratively reported that skin irritation was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, no adverse event was assessed as serious. While five deaths were reported in the cohort, three of these were from drowning, one was due to severe malaria and one to pneumonia; all of these deaths were judged to be unrelated to the study interventions. The review also reported data on ITN integrity from the United Republic of Tanzania[60]. The numbers (proportion) of torn ITNs (defined as hole area ≥ 790 cm2 and therefore not serviceable) were reported as 86 (28%) in the pyrethroid-only LLIN group, 96 (34%) in the pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITN group and 81 (43%) in the pyrethroid-PBO ITN group. The GDG noted that, compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs may exert an as yet unknown selection pressure for the development of resistance to pyrrole insecticides and non- oxygenase resistance mechanisms inAnophelesmosquito vectors. Overall, the GDG judged that the extent of undesirable effects associated with pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs was small compared to either pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs and that the overall balance of effects probably favours pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs.

Based on these data, the GDG judged that there are currently moderate additional costs associated with deploying pyrethroid‐chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs. Due to the scale of existing ITN coverage, the moderate additional cost per ITN could amount to considerable additional costs associated with a switch from pyrethroid-only LLINs to pyrethroid‐chlorfenapyr ITNs, which would need to be met in order to maintain the same population coverage. The GDG, however, remarked that unit costs change over time and often decrease as new technologies are brought to scale. As pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs are scaled up, further review will be needed to determine whether this cost difference remains. National programmes are encouraged to pay specific attention to the commodity cost, as this will also vary depending on required quantities and lead-times and will be a key ingredient to the separately developed guidance on ITN prioritization. Insecticide resistance status of the principal vector(s) in the area where deployment is planned should be assessed to justify deployment of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets. However, regular insecticide resistance testing by means of bioassays[22]should already be part of routine monitoring operations and programme budgets. The systematic review reported that the study conducted in the United Republic of Tanzania[60]carried out cost‐effectiveness analyses that compared pyrethroid‐chlorfenapyr ITNs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs to pyrethroid-only LLINs over the two-year period of the trial. Pyrethroid‐chlorfenapyr ITNs were estimated to avert 152 DALYs [SD 72] per 10 000 total population, while pyrethroid-PBO ITNs averted 37 DALYs [SD 72] per 10 000 population. When considering the costs of malaria diagnosis and treatment, pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs were reported to be less costly (incremental cost US$ 2894 [SD 1129] per 10 000 population) than pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (US$ 4816 [SD 1360]) from all perspectives. From societal and household perspectives, pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs would be more effective and less costly than either pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over a two-year period. The GDG concluded that the cost-effectiveness would probably favour pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs over pyrethroid-only LLINs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. The GDG was concerned that, given flatlined funding for malaria[3], the procurement of pyrethroid- chlorfenapyr ITNs may negatively impact the ability of programmes to maintain ITN coverage of at-risk populations.

Due to the current moderately higher cost of this commodity, there is a risk that programmes may not be able to maintain existing ITN coverage or coverage of other malaria interventions if no additional funds to cover the higher costs are made available. Somepragmatic prioritization guidance[61]has been provided with a view to supporting programmes in decision-making around the deployment of new types of nets in resource-constrained environments. Equity The GDG judged that the impact on the equity of using pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is variable. If switching from pyrethroid-only LLINs to more costly pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs would result in lower coverage of preventive interventions for those at risk of malaria, equity may be reduced. However, if the switch resulted in no reduction in coverage (due to increased funding or price reduction) and those populations who were previously provided with pyrethroid-only LLINs were then protected from malaria by a more effective intervention, equity would likely increase. Acceptability No research was identified regarding the acceptability of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs. However, the GDG judged that such ITNs would be acceptable to key stakeholders, given that they are largely similar to pyrethroid-only LLINs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in terms of their appearance, design and use, and given that they are currently available at a cost similar to that of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Feasibility Although no research was identified regarding the feasibility of implementing pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs, the GDG judged that deploying these ITNs would be as feasible as deploying pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. 52 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Justification Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs combine two active ingredients: a pyrethroid and a pyrrole insecticide. They are designed to kill mosquitoes that are resistant to pyrethroids and, as such, fall into the second class of ITNs recognized by WHO. Pyrrole insecticides such as chlorfenapyr disrupt adenosine 5'-triphosphate production in the mosquito’s mitochondria, thereby reducing the target insects' ability to produce energy and leading to cell dysfunction and subsequent death. Pyrethroids, meanwhile, target voltage-gated sodium channels associated with the nervous system of the insect, which results in muscular paralysis and rapid death. Due to its different mode of action, chlorfenapyr is, therefore, unlikely to show any cross-resistance to standard neurotoxic insecticides such as pyrethroids. Furthermore, death of the insect may occur 24–48 hours after exposure to chlorfenapyr, in contrast to pyrethroids, which result in a more rapid kill. The different entomological mode and site of action of chlorfenapyr may reduce selection pressure for insecticide resistance.

The different entomological mode and site of action of chlorfenapyr may reduce selection pressure for insecticide resistance. By including two active ingredients in an ITN, the likelihood of the mosquitoes being resistant to both is greatly reduced. Therefore, compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, pyrethroid- chlorfenapyr ITNs should have an increased killing effect against pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors and thus a greater impact against malaria. The systematic review [Barkeret alunpublished evidence] identified and included two trials[60][62]from eastern and western Africa evaluating the impact of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs on incidence of clinical malaria and prevalence of malaria infection, compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Both trials were conducted in areas with high malaria transmission (malaria infection prevalence in children under 10 years of age recorded as 20–40%) and pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes. Compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, incidence of clinical malaria (defined as malaria symptoms, i.e. current fever with a temperature ≥ 37.5°C or fever in the past 48 hours, plus malaria parasitaemia) was reduced by approximately 55% one year after deployment of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs and by 40% two years post-deployment. Prevalence of malaria infection (regardless of symptoms) was reduced by approximately 20% one year after deployment and by approximately 45% two years post-deployment. Compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs had little or no effect on incidence of clinical malaria one year after their deployment. However, after two years, incidence was reduced by 35%. Prevalence of malaria infection was reduced by approximately 20% one year post-deployment and by 30% two years post-deployment. The trials in Benin and in the United Republic of Tanzania will investigate the impact against malaria over 36‐month, which aligns with the replenishment cycle of ITNs in most field settings. Results are not available yet. When moving from the evidence provided by the systematic review to a decision as to the strength of the recommendation, the GDG concluded that there should be a strong recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas where malaria vectors are resistant to pyrethroids. This was due to the large effect against malaria and the high certainty that the benefits of deploying pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs would outweigh any harms. However, the panel concluded that the recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in areas of insecticide resistance should be conditional. This was based on the fact that the available evidence was from only one trial in the United Republic of Tanzania, where intensity of malaria transmission is high andAn. funestusis the primary malaria vector, which in turn limits generalizability of the findings to other geographies with different anopheline vectors and eco- epidemiological characteristics.

Furthermore, deploying pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs was associated with a moderate additional benefit compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs two years after ITN deployment, but with little or no difference in malaria outcomes one year after deployment. Research needs WHO encourages additional high-quality research to generate further evidence on: - the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyrITNs in areas with insecticide resistance traits in the local primary vectors that differ from those of the available studies; - contextual factors (e.g. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to use of pyrethroid‐chlorfenapyr ITNs; and - the durability of different pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs over the replenishment cycle of ITNs in field settings (generally three years or more). 53 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs vs pyrethroid-only LLINs (2023) Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs can be deployed instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance. The conditionality of the recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs is based on the GDG’s concerns that the available evidence indicates poor cost-effectiveness of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs. Poor cost-effectiveness is a result of both the higher cost compared to a pyrethroid-only net, which would require extra resources to maintain the same coverage, and the relatively short-lived (12 months) additional impact obtained by deploying pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen nets over pyrethroid-only nets. In deciding whether pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs should be deployed instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs, malaria programmes should: - determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra cost compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, while ensuring optimal coverage of populations at risk of malaria; - generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g. stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as pyrethroid resistance mechanisms); and - note that WHO recommends that ITNsprequalifiedby WHO be selected for deployment.

The conditionality of the recommendationagainstthe deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of effects favours pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs and that, based on current cost and efficacy data, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs are more cost-effective. The GDG acknowledged that evidence to support this recommendation is derived from only a single trial in Africa. Practical info Given that pyrethroid‐pyriproxyfen ITNs are designed to provide improved impact against resistant mosquitoes, pyrethroid resistance in potential target areas should be confirmed using standard procedures[22], as should susceptibility of the local vectors to pyriproxyfen. In any case, pyrethroid‐pyriproxyfen ITNs should not be considered a tool that alone can effectively manage insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. 54 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) As with all malaria interventions, post-distribution monitoring of ITNs to estimate coverage in terms of access to and use of ITNs is recommended. WHO also recommends that programmes conduct studies of ITN survival each time a campaign uses a new product such as pyrethroid‐pyriproxyfen ITNs, including assessment of ITN integrity. Such studies will provide information on the life span of the product under field conditions and thus enable estimation of the period over which the additional impact against malaria may be maintained. The systematic review reported that, two years after deployment, 39% of pyrethroid‐pyriproxyfen ITNs were torn (defined as having a total hole area ≥ 790 cm2 and therefore assumed to be not fit for use), compared to 28% of pyrethroid-only LLINs and 43% of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Given that the systematic review was limited to three studies with malaria outcomes, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined. The GDG concluded that the extent of the impact of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs is likely to vary by setting and will depend on several factors, such as intensity of malaria transmission, behaviour of the main malaria vectors, the level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance, and the usage of ITNs within a community. The GDG also noted that, across the studies, different pyrethroids (either permethrin or alphacypermethrin) were used in the ITNs and the impact on malaria may vary by the pyrethroid used. However, the panel’s overall judgement was that the anticipated desirable effects of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs would be moderate. Compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, the GDG considered the benefits to be minor. The trial from the United Republic of Tanzania[60]included in the systematic review reported 90 (44.1%) adverse events in the pyrethroid-only LLIN group, 80 (38.8%) in the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITN group and 17 (8.5%) in", "page_start": 54, "page_end": 55, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The authors also narratively reported that skin irritation was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, no adverse event was assessed as serious. While five deaths were reported in the cohort, three of these were from drowning, one was due to severe malaria and one was due to pneumonia; all deaths were judged to be unrelated to the study interventions. The review also reported data from the same trial[60]on ITN integrity. The numbers (proportion) of ITNs that were torn (defined as hole area ≥ 790 cm2) were reported as 86 (28%) in the pyrethroid-only LLIN group, 109 (39%) in the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITN group and 81 (43%) in the pyrethroid-PBO ITN group. Overall, the GDG judged the magnitude of undesirable effects associated with pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs to be small compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs. However, compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, the undesirable effects were judged to be large. Overall, the GDG concluded that, compared to pyrethroid- only LLINs, the balance of effects probably favours pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, but when comparing pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, the balance of effects was judged to favour the comparator, namely pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Certainty of the Moderate evidence Based on the systematic review, the GDG concluded that the overall certainty of evidence that pyrethroid- pyriproxyfen ITNs have an impact against malaria was moderate, compared to both pyrethroid-only LLINs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Values and No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably preferences no important uncertainty or variability associated with pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs. Resources Apart from the higher commodity cost of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, similar resources would be needed for their deployment as those listed for pyrethroid-only LLINs. (See table provided under “Resources and other considerations” for pyrethroid-only LLINs.) Based on cost data reported by the study in the United Republic of Tanzania[58], pyrethroid‐pyriproxyfen ITNs were estimated to cost US$ 3.68 per ITN, while pyrethroid-only LLINs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs were estimated to cost US$ 2.07 and US$ 2.98 per ITN, respectively. Based on these costs, estimated at 55 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) the time of the trial (2018), the GDG judged that there may be moderate additional costs associated with deploying pyrethroid‐pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid‐PBO ITNs.

Feasibility Although no research was identified regarding the feasibility of implementing pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, the GDG judged that deploying such ITNs would be as feasible as deploying pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Justification Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs combine a pyrethroid insecticide and an insect growth regulator (IGR). The two ingredients have different entomological effects. The pyrethroid insecticide rapidly kills mosquitoes by targeting voltage-gated sodium channels associated with the nervous system of the insect. The IGR is a hormone mimic that does not directly kill insects but disrupts their growth and reproduction. Mosquitoes that are not killed by the pyrethroid may be sterilized and/or have their fecundity reduced, 56 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) thereby preventing multiplication of the insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. Pyriproxyfen has also shown some impact on a mosquito’s life span. Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, therefore, fall into the third class of ITNs recognized by WHO, which consists of ITNs primarily designed to sterilize and/or reduce the fecundity of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. It is unlikely that mosquitoes exposed to ITNs that combine a pyrethroid and an IGR will be resistant to both active ingredients due to their different modes of action and limited to no selection pressure exerted so far for pyriproxyfen resistance. As such, pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs could have a greater impact against malaria than pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas with pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors. The systematic review [Barkeret alunpublished evidence] identified and included three trials[60][62][63]from western and eastern Africa, evaluating the impact of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs on incidence of clinical malaria and prevalence of malaria infection, compared to either pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. All trials were conducted in areas of high malaria transmission (malaria infection prevalence in children under 10 years of age recorded by the trials as 20–40% and as 50–70% in children under 5) and pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes. Compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, incidence of clinical malaria (defined as malaria symptoms, i.e. current fever of temperature ≥ 37·5°C or fever in the past 48 hours, plus malaria parasitaemia) decreased by approximately 20% one year after deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs and by 15% two years post-deployment.

Prevalence of malaria infection (regardless of symptoms) was reduced by approximately 30% one year post-deployment and by approximately 20% two years post-deployment. Compared with pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, the use of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs was associated with a two-fold higher incidence of clinical malaria one year after ITN deployment, with a slightly increased or no effect on incidence two years post-deployment. There was no effect on prevalence of malaria infection one or two years post- deployment. The trials in Benin and in the United Republic of Tanzania will investigate the impact against malaria over 36‐month, which aligns with the replenishment cycle of ITNs in most field settings. Results of these trials are expected to be appraised in the near future. The GDG concluded on a conditional recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas where malaria vectors are resistant to pyrethroids. The recommendation for deployment was based on the moderate effect against malaria and the GDG’s judgement that the benefits probably outweighed any harms of deploying pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs. The conditionality, however, was stipulated based on the panel conclusion that pyrethroid- pyriproxyfen ITNs were less cost-effective than pyrethroid-only LLINs and, due to the higher unit cost of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, extra resources would be required to replace pyrethroid-only LLINs with these dual active ingredient ITNs. Unless additional resources are provided, a switch to pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs would result in reduced coverage of populations at risk of malaria, thereby negatively affecting coverage and equity. The panel conditionally recommended against the deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in areas of insecticide resistance. This decision was based on the lack of evidence of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs having a greater impact against malaria compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs; the balance of effects favours pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over pyrethroid- pyriproxyfen ITNs. Based on these results and the current unit costs of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs are currently more cost-effective. Extra resources would be required while there would be no benefit of deploying pyrethroid- pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, and, in the absence of additional resources, this would result in reduced coverage of malaria interventions for populations at risk of malaria, thereby negatively affecting equity.

This recommendation is limited to classes of ITNs currently recommended by WHO. As with ITNs deployed in more stable settings, WHO recommends that ITNs that areprequalifiedby WHO be selected for use in humanitarian emergencies. When considering deployment of ITNs in humanitarian emergencies, the infrastructure, access, logistical capacity and resources available must be taken into account, as these may influence the feasibility and cost of procuring and deploying nets. Practical info In deciding whether to deploy ITNs in emergency settings, consideration must be given to whether ITNs are appropriate for that setting, taking into account vector characteristics, human behaviour and available infrastructure. ITNs are most effective where the principal malaria vector(s) bite predominantly at night after people have retired under their nets and where the mosquitoes are susceptible to the insecticides used to treat the nets. Data will need to be collected to assess whether these criteria are met. There may be more limited capacity to gather such data in humanitarian emergencies than in more stable settings. In addition to assessing whether ITNs are appropriate, consideration of the feasibility of deploying nets in a particular emergency setting is important. Depending on the infrastructure, access, logistical capacity and resources available, procuring and distributing nets may be more challenging than in more stable settings. Instability in such settings may challenge long-term planning and so result in shorter lead times and consequently higher costs.

Please consult the practical information under the WHO recommendations for the different ITN classes. However, as for collecting data to assess whether nets are suitable in an area, the feasibility and capacity to regularly collect information for M&E in emergency settings must be assessed. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review(Messengeret alunpublished evidence) assessed the epidemiological impact of pyrethroid-only LLINs against malaria compared to no nets in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies in the chronic phase – in Myanmar, on the Myanmar–Thailand border and in Pakistan[49][50][51][54]; no studies were found from areas in the acute phase of an emergency. The review presented evidence that pyrethroid-only LLINs were associated with reducedP. falciparum parasite incidence (rate ratio: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37–0.79; four studies; high-certainty evidence) andP. falciparumparasite prevalence (rate ratio: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.40–0.88); two studies; high-certainty evidence) compared to no nets. Deployment of pyrethroid-only LLINs was reported to probably result in reducedP. vivaxparasite incidence (rate ratio: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51–0.94; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Little or no difference was seen inP. vivaxparasite prevalence (risk ratio: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.75–1.34; two studies; low-certainty evidence). The systematic review did not report any unintended consequences of the intervention. However, the GDG noted that the potential undesirable effects identified for the use of ITNs in stable settings are also likely to apply in humanitarian emergencies. The GDG also noted that if nets are deployed in settings where the population is accommodated in tents or small houses (structures that are commonly shelters in emergency settings), uptake and use may be limited because the restricted space may not allow the net to be hung easily and the net may encroach on the space required for other household activities. The GDG judged these potential undesirable effects to be minimal. Although the studies included in the systematic review were limited to the use of pyrethroid-only LLINs, the likely benefits extend to other types of ITNs that are recommended by WHO for large-scale deployment in more stable settings (e.g. pyrethroid-PBO nets). The GDG judged the balance of benefits 58 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) and harms to favour the use of ITNs that have been recommended for use in more stable settings to prevent and control malaria in humanitarian emergency settings.

Certainty of the High evidence The systematic review assessed that the overall certainty of the evidence that pyrethroid‐only LLINs have an impact on malariain humanitarian emergency settingswas high. Values and No research was identified regarding preferences and values.The GDG judged that there was probably preferences no important uncertainty or variability. Resources Based on cost data published in 2021[36], the median economic cost of ITNs was US$ 1.39 per person protected per year, drawing on data from non-emergency settings. The GDG noted that the cost of deploying nets in humanitarian emergency settings may be higher than in stable settings for a number of reasons. First, the cost of transporting nets may increase, particularly for locations that are difficult to access. Second, in some emergency settings, there may be a need to establish human capacity for net delivery, which could incur further cost. Finally, given the nature of emergency settings, the necessity for immediate deployment of interventions may require shorter lead times for procurement, resulting in higher costs of the commodity. The GDG judged that deploying ITNs would therefore involve moderate costs and cost more than deploying ITNs in stable settings. A review of the cost and cost-effectiveness of malaria control interventions[36]in more stable settings reported that the cost-effectiveness of ITNs compared to no ITNs was US$ 5.85 per episode averted, US$ 1281.97 per death averted, and US$ 44.51 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The GDG noted that the cost-effectiveness of deploying pyrethroid-only LLINs may depend largely on the setting: the cost-effectiveness may vary with the infrastructure in the setting and available capacity, as well as the malaria transmission level in the area of deployment. The GDG judged that, while there may be some upfront costs to deliver nets in such settings, given the associated benefits to protecting such vulnerable populations, deploying pyrethroid-only LLINs would be cost-effective compared to no nets. Equity Providing ITNs to populations in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by humanitarian emergencies was judged by the GDG to result in increased equity, as populations in these settings are at increased risk of malaria infection. Acceptability No research was identified regarding the acceptability of pyrethroid-only LLINs in emergency settings. Nevertheless, the GDG judged that ITNs would be acceptable to key stakeholders, given that they are generally well accepted in more stable settings. The acceptability may improve further over time as users see the benefit to protecting themselves from malaria.

The GDG judged that distributing ITNs would be feasible, but consideration would need to be given to whether: - the sleeping structures in the setting are amenable to having nets installed; - nets can be procured in time and within the given budget; - there is sufficient human capacity to deliver nets in the emergency setting; and - there are sufficient resources available to cover potential extra costs to access the population, particularly hard-to-reach populations and those affected by conflict. 59 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Justification The systematic review[55](Messengeret alunpublished evidence) compared pyrethroid‐only LLINs to no nets in terms of malaria outcomes in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies. The review concluded that deploying pyrethroid‐only LLINs was associated with reductions inP. falciparumparasite incidence,P. falciparumparasite prevalence andP. vivaxparasite incidence compared to no nets. It was unclear whether pyrethroid‐only LLINs reducedP. vivaxparasite prevalence in these settings.The included studies were all from emergencies in the chronic phase in Asia – in the Republic of Union ofMyanmar, on theMyanmar–Thailandborder, andin theIslamicRepublicofPakistan.Deploying netsin theacute stageof anemergency may differ from deploying nets once some infrastructure has been established, due to numerous logistical challenges. Humanitarian emergenciesin otherparts ofthe worldmay differin termsof theavailable capacity,infrastructure, community behaviour and acceptance. Given that the systematic review only identified and included four trials, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined. However, as for pyrethroid-only LLINs deployed in more stable settings, the impact of nets may vary depending on, for example, the behaviour of the mosquito species, the level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance, parasite prevalence, and net usage by the population. While the review included studies that only examined the impact of pyrethroid-only LLINs, other ITNs recommended by WHO in more stable settings are likely to have a similar balance of benefits and harms to those deployed in humanitarian emergencies. Important considerations regarding resource needs, acceptability and feasibility when deploying pyrethroid-only LLINs in emergency settings should largely apply to other WHO-recommended ITNs. Based on the review findings and these considerations, the GDG judged that the desirable effects of deploying WHO-recommended ITNs, not just pyrethroid-only LLINs, in humanitarian emergencies compared to no nets would outweigh the undesirable effects. Based on the high certainty of the findings from emergency settings and the feasibility, acceptability and cost-effectiveness of ITNs in more stable settings, the panel felt that the recommendation should be classified as strong.

Practice Statement Achieving and maintaining optimal coverage with ITNs for malaria prevention and control (2019) To achieve and maintain optimal ITN coverage, countries should apply mass free net distribution through campaigns, combined with other locally appropriate delivery mechanisms such as continuous distribution using antenatal care (ANC) clinics and the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Recipients of ITNs should be advised (through appropriate communicationstrategies) to continue using their nets, irrespective of the condition and age of the net, until a replacement net is available. Practical info To achieve and maintain optimal ITN coverage, countries should apply a combination of mass free net distribution through campaigns and continuous distribution through multiple channels, in particular through ANC clinics and the EPI. Mass campaigns are the only proven cost-effective way to rapidly achieve high and equitable coverage. Complementary continuous distribution channels are also required because coverage gaps can start to appear almost immediately post-campaign due to net deterioration, loss of nets, and population growth. Mass campaigns should distribute one ITN for every two persons at risk of malaria. However, for procurement purposes, the calculation to determine the number of ITNs required needs to be adjusted at the population level, since many households have an odd number of members. Therefore, a ratio of one ITN for every 1.8 persons in the target population should be used to estimate ITN requirements, unless data to inform a different quantification ratio are available. In places where the most recent population census is more than five years old, countries can consider including a buffer (e.g. adding 10% after the 1.8 ratio has been applied) or using data from previous ITN campaigns to justify an alternative buffer amount. Campaigns should also normally be planned to 60 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) be repeated every three years, unless available empirical evidence justifies the use of a longer or shorter interval between campaigns. In addition to these data-driven decisions, a shorter distribution interval may be justified during humanitarian emergencies, as the resulting increase in population movement may leave populations uncovered by vector control, potentially increasing their risk of infection as and the risk of epidemics. Continuous distribution through ANC and EPI channels should remain functional before, during and after mass distribution campaigns.

Continuous distribution through ANC and EPI channels should remain functional before, during and after mass distribution campaigns. In determining the optimal mix of ITN delivery mechanisms to ensure optimal coverage and maximized efficiency, consideration should be given to the required number of nets, the cost per net distributed and coverage over time. For example, during mass distribution campaign years, other delivery schemes may need to be altered to avoid-over supply of ITNs. “Top-up” campaigns (i.e. ITN distributions that take into account existing nets in households and provide each household only with the additional number of nets needed to bring it up to the target number) are not recommended. Substantial field experience has shown that accurate quantification for such campaigns is generally not feasible and the cost of accounting for existing nets outweighs the benefits. There should be a single national ITN plan and policy that includes both continuous and campaign distribution strategies. This should be developed and implemented under the leadership of the NMP, based on an analysis of local opportunities and constraints, and identification of a combination of distribution channels with which to achieve optimal coverage and minimize gaps. This unified plan should include a comprehensive net quantification and gap analysis for all public sector ITN distribution channels. As much as possible, the plan should include major ITN contributions by the private sector. Therefore, in addition to mass campaigns, the distribution strategy could include: - ANC, EPI and other child health clinics: These should be considered high-priority continuous ITN distribution channels in countries where these services are used by a large proportion of the population at risk of malaria, as occurs in much of sub- Saharan Africa. - Schools, faith- and community-based networks, and agricultural and food-security support schemes: These can also be explored as channels for ITN distribution in countries where such approaches are feasible and equitable. Investigating the potential use of these distribution channels in complex emergencies is particularly important. - Occupation-related distribution channels: In some settings, particularly in Asia, the risk of malaria may be strongly associated with specific occupations (e.g. plantation and farm workers and their families, miners, soldiers and forest workers). In these settings, opportunities for distribution through channels such as private sector employers, workplace programmes and farmers’ organizations may be explored. - Private or commercial sector channels: These can be important channels for supplementing free ITN distribution through public sector channels.

ITN products distributed through the private sector should be regulated by the national registrar of pesticides in order to ensure that product quality is in line with WHO recommendations. The procurement of ITNs with attributes that are more costly (e.g., nets of conical shape) is not recommended for countries in sub- Saharan Africa, unless nationally representative data clearly show that the use of ITNs with particular attributes increases significantly among populations at risk of malaria. To build an evidence base to support the purchase of more costly nets, investigation into the population's preferences and whether adhering to those preferences translates into increased use of ITNs may also be warranted, particularly in situations where standard nets are unlikely to suit the lifestyle of specific population groups at risk of malaria, such as may be the case for nomadic populations. The life spans of ITNs can vary widely among individual nets used within a single household or community, as well as among nets used in different settings. This makes it difficult to plan the rate or frequency at which replacement nets need to be procured and delivered. All malaria programmes that have undertaken medium- to large-scale ITN distributions should conduct ITN durability monitoring in line with available guidance to inform appropriate replacement intervals. Where there is evidence that ITNs are not being adequately cared for or used, programmes should design and implement BCC activities aimed at improving these behaviours. In countries where untreated nets are widely available, NMPs should promote access to ITNs. Strategies for treating untreated nets can also be considered, for example, by supporting access to insecticide treatment kits. As NMPs implement different mixes of distribution methods in different geographic areas, there will be a need to accurately track ITN coverage at subnational levels. Subnational responses should be triggered if coverage falls below programmatic targets. Tracking should differentiate among the contributions of various delivery channels to overall ITN coverage. 61 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Countries should generate data on defined standard indicators of coverage and access rates in order to ascertain whether optimal coverage has been achieved and maintained. The data should also inform changes in implementation in order to improve performance and progress towards the achievement of programmatic targets. Currently, the three basic survey indicators are: i) the proportion of households with at least one ITN; ii) the proportion of the population with access to an ITN within their household; and iii) the proportion of the population reporting having slept under an ITN the previous night (by age [<5 years; 5–14 years; 15+ years], gender and access to", "page_start": 61, "page_end": 62, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Justification In December 2017, WHO published updated recommendations onAchieving and maintaining universal coverage with LLINs for malaria control[64].These recommendations were developed and revised based on expert opinion through broad consultation, including multiple rounds of reviews by the Malaria Policy Advisory Group (MPAG). Under the section on “practical information”, these recommendations have been summarized and slightly revised to clarify that these recommendations are not specific to LLINs, but apply to ITNs in general. Practice Statement Management of old ITNs (2019) Old ITNs should only be collected where there is assurance that: i) communities are not left without nets, i.e. new ITNs are distributed to replace old ones; and ii) there is a suitable and sustainable plan in place for safe disposal of the collected material. If ITNs and their packaging (bags and baling materials) are collected, the best option for disposal is high-temperature incineration. They should not be burned in the open air. In the absence of appropriate facilities, they should be buried away from water sources and preferably in non-permeable soil. Recipients of ITNs should be advised (through appropriate communication strategies) not to dispose of their nets in any water body, as the residual insecticide on the net can be toxic to aquatic organisms (especially fish). Practical info It is important to determine whether the environmental benefits outweigh the costs when identifying the best disposal option for old ITNs and their packaging. For malaria programmes in most endemic countries, there are limited options for dealing with ITN collection. Recycling is not currently a practical option in most malaria-endemic countries (with some exceptions for countries with a well-developed plastics industry). High-temperature incineration is likely to be logistically difficult and expensive in most settings. In practice, when malaria programmes have retained or collected packaging material in the process of distributing ITNs, it has mostly been burned in the open air. This method of disposal may lead to the release of dioxins, which are harmful to human health. If such plastic material (with packaging an issue at the point of distribution and old ITNs an intermittent issue at household level when the net is no longer in use) is left in the community, it is likely to be re-used in a variety of ways. While the insecticide exposure entailed by this kind of re-use has yet to be fully studied, the expected negative health and environmental impacts of leaving the waste in the community are considered to be less than amassing it in one location and/or burning it in the open air.", "page_start": 62, "page_end": 62, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

While the insecticide exposure entailed by this kind of re-use has yet to be fully studied, the expected negative health and environmental impacts of leaving the waste in the community are considered to be less than amassing it in one location and/or burning it in the open air. Since the material from nets represents only a small proportion of total plastic consumption, it will often be more efficient for old ITNsto be dealt with as part of larger and more general solid-waste programmes. National environment management authorities have an obligation to consider and plan for what happens to old ITNs and packaging materials in the environment in collaboration with other relevant partners. Justification Currently, ITNs and the vast majority of their packaging (bags and baling materials) are made of non-biodegradable plastics[65]. The large-scale deployment of ITNs has given rise to questions as to the most appropriate and cost-effective way to deal with the resulting plastic waste, particularly given that most endemic countries do not currently have the resources to manage ITN collection and waste disposal programmes. A pilot study was conducted to examine patterns of ITNusage and disposal in three African countries (Kenya, Madagascar and United Republic of Tanzania). Findings of this pilot study, along with other background information were used to generate recommendations through the WHO Vector Control Technical Expert Group (VCTEG) and MPAG on best practices with respect to managing waste. 62 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) The following are the main findings from the pilot study and other background material: - ITNs entering domestic use in Africa each year contribute approximately 100 000 tonnes of plastic and represent a per capita rate of plastic consumption of 200g per year. This is substantial in absolute terms; however, itconstitutes only approximately 1% to 5% of the total plastic consumption in Africa and thus is small compared to other sources of plastic and other forms of plastic consumption. - The plastic from ITNs is treated with a small amount of pyrethroid insecticide (less than 1% per unit mass for most products), and plastic packaging is therefore considered a pesticide product/container. - Old ITNs and other nets may be used for a variety of alternative purposes, usually due to the perceived ineffectiveness of the net, loss of net physical integrity or presence of another net. - ITNs that no longer serve a purpose are generally disposed of at the community level along with other household waste by discarding them in the environment, burning them in the open, or placing them into pits. - ITN collection was not implemented on a large scale or sustained in any of the pilot study countries. It may be feasible to recycle ITNs, but it is not practical or cost-effective at this point, as", "page_start": 62, "page_end": 63, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

It may be feasible to recycle ITNs, but it is not practical or cost-effective at this point, as there would need to be specialized adaptation and upgrading of recycling facilities before insecticide-contaminated materials could be included in this process. - Two important and potentially hazardous practices are: i) routinely removing ITNs from bags at the point of distribution and burning discarded bags and old ITNs, which can produce highly toxic fumes including dioxins, and ii) discarding old ITNs and their packaging in water, as they may contain high concentrations of residual insecticides that are toxic to aquatic organisms, particularly fish. - Insecticide-treated plastics can be incinerated safely in high-temperature furnaces, but suitable facilities are lacking in most countries. Burial away from water sources and preferably in non-permeable soil is an appropriate method to dispose of net bags and old ITNs in the absence of a suitable high-temperature incinerator. - In most countries, ministries of environment (national environment management authorities) are responsible for setting up and enforcing laws/regulations to manage plastic waste broadly. Although some countries have established procedures for dealing with pesticide-contaminated plastics, it is unrealistic to expect NMPs to single-handedly address the problem of managing waste from ITNs. Environmental regulations; leadership and guidance from national environmental authorities; and oversight from international agencies, such as the United Nations Environment Programme, are all necessary. Updated Strong recommendation for , Very low certainty evidence Indoor residual spraying (2025) IRS should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults living in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. WHO recommends that products from the insecticide classes indicated below be used for IRS. Selection of the product should be made from the WHO list ofprequalified products, and with due consideration of the insecticide susceptibility of the local malaria vector(s). IRS is considered to be an appropriate intervention where: - the majority of the vector population feeds and rests indoors; - people mainly sleep indoors at night; - the malaria transmission pattern is such that the population can be protected by one or two rounds of IRS per year; and - the majority of structures are suitable for spraying.

Furthermore, surfaces may be fully or partially treated (such as treating the lower or upper sections of walls or specific rooms). The latter approach may be more cost-effective. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether partial surface treatments are as effective or as cost-effective as full surface treatments. The practical guidance provided here, therefore, refers to the implementation of IRS treating all indoor surfaces of a structure. IRS is considered to be an appropriate intervention where: - the majority of the vector population tends to feed and rest indoors; - people mainly sleep indoors at night; 63 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - the malaria transmission pattern is such that the population can be protected by one or two rounds of IRS per year; - the majority of structures are suitable for spraying. IRS may not be suitable for some structures, such as open-sided structures, but, in general, insecticides can be applied to several different wall types (e.g. cement, painted surfaces, brick, wood, mud). However, it is important to consider whether the surface material compromises the residual nature of the insecticide (e.g. some plastic sheeting materials). The longevity of the insecticide also varies with the insecticide used and its formulation. Residual efficacy, i.e. the insecticide’s ability to still kill mosquitoes that are exposed to sprayed surfaces, needs to continue for at least the duration of the malaria transmission season following the application of the insecticide to the substrate. If treatment of certain surfaces or use of a particular insecticide and/or formulation reduces its residual life, additional spray rounds may be needed to provide population protection throughout the transmission season(s). More information is provided in the WHO publicationOperational manual on indoor residual spraying: control of vectors of malaria, Aedes-borne diseases, Chagas disease, leishmaniases and lymphatic filariasis[66]. Insecticide formulations for IRS currently recommended by WHO fall into fall into several major insecticide classes with different modes of action on the vector species. The insecticide classes with products that have been prequalified, as listed below. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors - Organophosphates: pirimiphos-methyl - Carbamates: bendiocarb Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor competitive modulators - Neonicotinoids: clothianidin GABA-gated chloride channel allosteric modulators - Meta-diamides: broflanilide - Isoxazolines: isocycloseram Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation via disruption of the proton gradient - Pyrroles: chlorfenapyr Sodium channel modulators - Pyrethroids: alphacypermethrin, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, etofenprox, bifenthrin - Organochlorines (e.g. DDT): no prequalified products available While the organochlorine DDT has a long history of use for IRS, there are no organochlorine IRS formulations prequalified.

This means that no DDT product has been assessed by WHO for its efficacy, safety and quality for vector control, and no inspection of manufacturing sites has been conducted. Unlike the other insecticide classes covered by WHO’s recommendation for IRS, DDT has been classified as a persistent organic pollutant. As such, its production and use are strictly restricted by an international agreement known as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants [79]. The Convention’s objective is to protect both human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants. When the Stockholm Convention was established in 2004, it provided an exemption for the production and use of DDT for disease vector control, mainly because of the absence of equally effective and efficient alternatives at the time. However, the expansion of products available for IRS and overall innovation in vector control interventions have provided multiple viable options as alternatives to using DDT in IRS. WHO actively supports the promotion of chemical safety and, together with the United Nations Environment Programme, shares a common commitment to the global goal of reducing and eventually eliminating the use of DDT, while minimizing the burden of vector-borne diseases. DDT use for malaria vector control has declined over the years and WHO supports the use of alternative insecticides or other vector control methods. 64 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) With the availability of multiple classes of insecticides for IRS, there are very few cases in which the use of DDT may still be warranted. Any decision to use DDT for malaria vector control needs to be based on a detailed analysis that considers all other potential options for vector control and provides clear reasoning for choosing DDT over the other options. WHO considers DDT to be a last resort, not a first choice. If DDT is selected, it should be used under strict control measures and only for the intended purpose. Its use requires that the conditions set by the Stockholm Convention be met. Effective use and safe storage of DDT rely on compliance with well-established and well-enforced rules and regulations in accordance with national guidelines and following WHO technical guidance provided in the WHO operational manual for IRS for malaria transmission, control and elimination [66]. Where DDT is deployed, it is essential for adequate resources and technical support to be in place to ensure the sound management of this persistent organic pollutant.

Where DDT is deployed, it is essential for adequate resources and technical support to be in place to ensure the sound management of this persistent organic pollutant. When selecting insecticides for IRS, it is important to investigate the resistance profile of the local vectors to select insecticides that are effective against the local dominant vectors. Continuous use of the same product in the same area for multiple seasons is not recommended, as this may select for resistance in mosquitoes. Switching to other insecticides to which mosquitoes are susceptible should therefore be planned proactively. Furthermore, in deciding which products and formulations to procure, residual efficacy must be considered. Insecticides should remain efficacious throughout the transmission season after application and must do so when applied to a variety of surfaces (cement, mud or wood) [80]. Insecticides are available in various formulations to increase their longevity on different surfaces. Community acceptance of IRS is critical to the programme’s success, particularly because it requires householders to grant permission for spray teams to enter their house. It also involves disruption to the household, requiring householders to remove personal items from their house prior to spraying. Furthermore, some insecticide formulations leave unsightly residue on sprayed surfaces and may cause decolourization of painted surfaces. Repeated, frequent spraying of houses over extended periods can lead to refusal by householders. Reduced acceptance has been an impediment to effective IRS implementation in various parts of the world [81]. It is therefore important to develop information, education and communication (IEC) strategies to keep the community informed and engage with communities to ensure full support and cooperation. IRS is generally conducted campaign-style across a large geographical area or higher risk area prior to the beginning of a malaria transmission season (i.e. proactive spraying). However, IRS can be deployed in a much smaller, more targeted way in the likely location of infection of an index case and its neighbours. This is termed reactive IRS; further information and guidance is provided under the “Interventions in the final phase of elimination and prevention of re-establishment” section of these Guidelines. When IRS is deployed proactively in wider areas of ongoing malaria transmission, it is important to maintain optimal coverage (see Section 4.1.1 interventions recommended for large scale deployment and the glossary for further details on how optimal coverage is determined). Following application of the insecticide(s), it is important to determine the quality of the application and to subsequently monitor the residual activity by using wall cone bioassays. It is also important to evaluate the impact of IRS through entomological surveillance activities and assess any impact on the environment.

This manual is designed to assist malaria programme managers, entomologists and public health officers in designing, implementing, and monitoring and evaluating high-quality IRS programmes. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms An updated systematic review (Stoneet alunpublished evidence) investigated the impact of residual surface treatment (RST) of insecticides on malaria compared to no vector control intervention. RST could be applied indoors or outdoors to parts of the wall/ceiling or to its entirety, and involve different delivery methods. The current best practice in this area is IRS (see section 4.1.1). Only studies on the impact of IRS against malaria could be identified; no studies were identified on outdoor applications or applying treatments in other ways. Ten studies of IRS from Africa and Asia were included in the review: five cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), one quasi-experimental study and four controlled before- and-after studies. The systematic review of these studies reported little or no effect of IRS on malaria incidence compared to no spraying (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.63–1.29; very low-certainty evidence) and provided very low-certainty evidence that all-age malaria parasite prevalence was lower in IRS study areas than in those without IRS. As the post-IRS period during which the impact was measured varied across studies, a summary estimate of the relative risk (RR) could not be calculated. Nevertheless, 65 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) individual studies reported an RR of malaria infection of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.65–0.75) one month after application and of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.66–0.70) one year after deployment, compared to no IRS. The systematic review excluded studies in which other vector control interventions were being used, including insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). A separate systematic review investigating the impact of co- deploying IRS and ITNs compared to deploying ITNs alone was reviewed by the panel under a separate recommendation (see section 4.1.2) and is therefore not addressed here. Furthermore, studies comparing IRS to ITNs were not eligible for inclusion. However, nets were present across both arms in a few of the included studies, but at a low coverage level that was not deemed to result in a community- level impact against mosquito populations. Nevertheless, to determine whether the presence of nets at these levels did have a potential modifying effect against malaria incidence and prevalence, a subgroup analysis was carried out. The review reported that low coverage of nets had no significant modifying effect, although the number of studies included for each analysis was small. Subgroup analyses were also undertaken to investigate whether insecticide class and transmission intensity could have modifying effects against malaria incidence and prevalence.Neitherinsecticide class nor transmission intensity resulted in significant effects,butthe numberof", "page_start": 65, "page_end": 66, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The GDG concluded that the extent of the impact of IRS is likely to vary by setting and will depend on a number of other factors, such as the intensity of malaria transmission, the behaviour of the main malaria vectors, the level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance, coverage of IRS and other vector control interventions, and operational factors associated with the implementation of IRS. Despite the little evidence drawn from these particular study designs, the impact of IRS on malaria has been demonstrated historically in multiple campaigns, such as during the Global Malaria Eradication Campaign in the 1950s[81], and various national programmatic deployments of IRS (e.g.[67][68][69][70][71]). Based on three studies included in the systematic review that reported unintended outcomes, most adverse events were considered mild. The frequency at which these adverse events occurred however, was not reported. In Pakistan, transitory skin irritation and headaches were reported in spray personnel and participants shortly after spraying. However, this effect attenuated after a few hours. Similar adverse events were reported in spray personnel in another study in the United Republic of Tanzania, where, despite wearing goggles and face masks, spray personnel suffered from paresthesia in their facial skin. Overall, the GDG judged the extent of undesirable effects associated with IRS to be small compared to no IRS. Certainty of the Very low evidence The GDG concluded that the overall certainty of evidence was very low, based on the studies that met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review (Stoneet alunpublished evidence).Despite anecdotal evidencedemonstrating programmatic efficacy, for example in the 1950s as part of global malaria elimination efforts led by WHO, and the efforts of several national programmes in subsequent years,the systematic review evaluated the evidence derived from the included scientific studies, with pre-specified assessments for bias, indirectness, imprecision and inconsistency, as being of very low certainty evidence. WHO has thus moved forward with the most conservative level of evidence certainty and applied this to the global body of evidence. Values and No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably preferences no important uncertainty or variability.

The GDG commented that due to the community effect of IRS, which could reduce overall mosquito populations, even those who do not receive IRS could benefit, and thus equity would increase. However, the panel noted that larger populations with greater density and those that can be accessed more readily might be prioritized for IRS deployment over communities that consist of households distributed over a large geographical area, which could potentially reduce equity.The type of housing structure may also play a role in equity and should be considered.To increase health equity, the GDG stressed the need to target the populations most at risk for malaria when deploying IRS. Acceptability The systematic review reported that wall decolourization, bad smell, an increase in bed bug nuisance, and contamination of food grains were reported by study participants in India after spraying with DDT[78]. However, these factors may depend on the insecticide and formulation used. In another study conducted in Pakistan[56], no persistent odour or residue was reported after spraying with the pyrethroid insecticide alpha-cypermethrin. In this same study, it was reported that household residents appreciated IRS because it controlled both nuisance and vector mosquitoes. In another study in the United Republic of Tanzania[72], participants were generally satisfied with house spraying, with no study households refusing IRS. However, the GDG noted that these findings were from only a few studies and that a larger review on acceptability and other contextual factors surrounding IRS was needed. Feasibility No research was identified regarding the feasibility of implementing IRS. However, the GDG judged that, given that IRS is and has been successfully deployed by many programmes globally, its implementation is likely to be feasible. Justification The systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact against malaria of RST applied indoors or outdoors compared to no vector control, but only IRS studies met the inclusion criteria. The scope of the latest review was widened to include both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and study designs other than RCTs (i.e. non-randomized controlled trials and controlled before-and-after studies). However, even with inclusion of these other study designs, the review provided very low-certainty evidence that IRS had any impact on malaria incidence (IRR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.63–1.29) and that all-age malaria parasite prevalence was lower in IRS study areas than in those without IRS one", "page_start": 68, "page_end": 68, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Despite its long tradition and the large body of associated operational experience, few RCTs or other controlled studies have evaluated IRS compared to not deploying any vector control intervention. Of those studies that have been conducted, many were carried out over 10 years ago, and all assessed the impact of IRS using fast-acting insecticides. That being said however, when carried out in wide-scale programmes, IRS has historically demonstrated itself to be an efficacious intervention for reducing adult mosquito vector density and longevity, and therefore, at least indirectly, has demonstrated its efficacy in reducing malaria transmission. Considering the previous programmatic success of the intervention, and the present challenge to find suitable trial sites in which the standard of care could be ‘no intervention’, it was deemed unlikely that any body of high-quality evidence stemming from future RCTs of an adequate scale would be generated to further underpin the refinement of the recommendation. Thus, the historical success of efficacious programmatic IRS has driven the ‘strong’ recommendation for deployment of the intervention in this instance, despite the lack of more recent high-quality scientific evidence derived from well-designed trials with appropriate controls. The systematic review did not include studies in which other vector control interventions were used. Studies have been conducted and a systematic review undertaken to evaluate the impact of deploying IRS where ITNs are used. A recommendation regarding the co-deployment of IRS and ITNs is provided in Section 4.1.2 and is not addressed here. Furthermore, a recent cRCT in 68 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Mozambique and the United Republic of Tanzania comparing IRS to ITNs found highly protective effects; again, however, such studies were not eligible for inclusion in the current systematic review because the comparator arm involved another vector control intervention. The GDG considered that, despite the very low certainty of the evidence provided by the systematic review, the strong WHO recommendation for IRS previously published should be maintained, based on the fact that historical malaria eradication efforts and a number of implementation trials and programmatic deployments of IRS have demonstrated impact against malaria[67][68][69][70][71]. Research needs WHO encourages additional high-quality research to generate further evidence on: - the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of IRS in urbanized areas with changing housing designs; - the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical]", "page_start": 68, "page_end": 69, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Given ethical considerations associated with conducting trials that evaluate IRS against ‘no vector control intervention’, WHO encourages research comparing different vector control tools, such as IRS and ITNs, to generate evidence on their relative impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences. Conditional recommendation for , Very low certainty evidence Indoor residual spraying: Humanitarian emergency setting (2022) IRS can be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by a humanitarian emergency. The conditionality of this recommendation is largely driven by the very low certainty of the evidence that IRS reduces malaria in such settings and due to concerns around feasibility and cost. When deciding whether IRS may be appropriate for prevention and control of malaria in humanitarian emergency settings, programmes should consider: - whether the structures are suitable for spraying. Some shelters provided in emergency settings may not be suitable for application of insecticides, such as open-sided structures and those built from materials that affect the residual nature of the insecticides; - whether the target coverage of IRS can be feasibly achieved in the setting; - whether there are sufficient resources to cover the relatively high costs associated with an IRS programme. In such settings, transport of commodities to hard-to-reach areas, coupled with the need to quickly procure items and establish human capacity to deliver the intervention, is likely to incur higher costs than when deploying IRS in more stable settings. As with the deployment of IRS in more stable settings, WHO recommends that products from insecticide classes indicated under the WHO recommendation, and that have beenWHO-prequalifiedbe", "page_start": 69, "page_end": 69, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

As with the deployment of IRS in more stable settings, WHO recommends that products from insecticide classes indicated under the WHO recommendation, and that have beenWHO-prequalifiedbe selected for IRS use in humanitarian emergencies. It is important to ensure that the vector population is susceptible to the insecticide selected for spraying. Practical info In deciding whether to deploy IRS in emergency settings, as in more stable settings, consideration must be given to whether IRS is a suitable intervention for that setting, taking into account vector characteristics, human behaviour and available infrastructure. IRS 69 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) isconsidered an appropriate intervention where the majority of the vector population feeds and rests indoors; the vectors are susceptible to the insecticide that is being deployed; people mainly sleep indoors at night; the majority of structures are suitable for spraying; and where high enough coverage can be achieved to provide community-level protection. Data will need to be collected to assess whether these criteria are met. Data onvector composition, density, behaviour and insecticide susceptibility prior to deploying IRS not only provide information as to whether IRS is suitable in that setting, but also provide baseline information against which changes can be detected and monitored. Combined with data on coverage, this information can be used togauge the effectiveness and efficiency of IRS. However, there may be more limited capacity to regularly gather such data in humanitarian emergencies than in more stable settings. Data are also required on the structures present in humanitarian emergencies to assess whether they are amenable to IRS. Open-sided structures or those with surfaces constructed from materials that impact the residual nature of the spray may not be suitable. Initiating any IRS programme requires a well-defined management system to be established withdedicated human, logistical, transport and financial resources.Programmes and implementing partners should consider whether the logistical needs (acquisition of commodities and equipment, recruitment of personnel and transport) can be met in emergency situations with the available resources within the given timeframe. Timeliness is a key factor in obtaining the maximum benefits from IRS; the spray should be applied over the shortest period of time just prior to the onset of the transmission season. As with ITNs, instability in humanitarian emergencies may reduce the options for long-term planning, resulting in shorter lead times for establishing a programme and acquiring supplies and equipment than in more stable settings. If commodities and personnel have to be sourced at short notice, procurement costs may be higher. Costs may also increase if more expensive means of transport are required for deployment in more remote, less accessible areas or those affected by conflict.

Costs may also increase if more expensive means of transport are required for deployment in more remote, less accessible areas or those affected by conflict. As with more stable settings, ensuring optimal coverage to provide community-level protection is critical. To support this community acceptance of IRS is essential. Given that in some humanitarian emergencies, the local language may differ to that of the affected population, consideration should be given to whether messaging needs to be adapted. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review[55](Messengeret alunpublished evidence)assessed the epidemiological impact of IRS against malaria compared to no IRS in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies in the chronic phase; no studies were found from areas in the acute phase of an emergency. One RCT was carried out in Sudan[82]and two controlled before-after studies and one cross-sectional study were conducted in Pakistan[52][83][84]. While the case incidence ofP. falciparumwas lower with IRS, only one observational study contributed to this evidence(rate ratio: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.53–0.61; very low-certainty evidence).There was little to no difference inP. falciparumparasite prevalence between arms (rate ratio: 1.31; 95% CI: 0.91–1.88; one study; low-certainty evidence). P. vivaxcase incidence was lower compared to no IRS (rate ratio: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.49–0.52; very low-certainty evidence); however, only one observational study was included. Little or no difference was seen inP. vivaxparasite prevalence between arms (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.25–2.14; two studies; very low-certainty evidence). The GDG judged that the extent of the desirable effects of IRS compared to no IRS is likely to vary depending on a number of factors. Many of these factors also apply to more stable settings: IRS works best when the majority of vectors rest indoors and are susceptible to the insecticides used; where people sleep indoors; where the population is not nomadic; and where the structures are sprayable and not too scattered. The suitability of structures for spraying is an important factor to consider in emergency settings. Tents are often used to provide emergency shelter and not all tent material will allow the application of the insecticide by spraying; in some areas, structures are open-sided. It may be that IRS is more appropriate in the chronic phase of an emergency than in the acute phase due to the type of shelter, infrastructure and human capacity likely to have been established by this later stage. The systematic review did not report any unintended consequences of the intervention.

These undesirable effects were judged by the GDG to be minimal. The GDG judged the balance of benefits and harms to probably favour the use of IRS against malaria compared to no IRS in humanitarian emergency settings. Certainty of the Very low evidence 70 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) The systematic review assessed the overall certainty of evidence that IRS has an impact on malaria in humanitarian emergency settings to be very low. Values and No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably preferences no important uncertainty or variability. Resources The resources needed for IRS in humanitarian emergencies are, at a minimum, the same as those needed for delivery of IRS in more stable settings (see “Resources and other considerations” table, section 4.1.1), but the overall cost is likely to be higher due to the various logistical issues noted below. Based on cost data published in 2021[36]the median economic cost per person protected per year was estimated to be US$ 5.70 in stable settings. As in stable settings, establishing an IRS programme in an area for the first time requires a great amount of resources. In emergency settings, increased costs are assumed to be associated with transporting commodities and personnel to areas where access is limited by geography or conflict, the fact that shorter lead times for procurement generally result in higher cost of goods, and the need to quickly establish capacity (recruitment and training of personnel, establishment of operation sites, i.e. stores, soak pits, and wash areas) to protect the at-risk population and avoid a potential malaria epidemic. The GDG therefore judged that deploying IRS in such settings would likely involve high costs. Data from a review of the cost and cost-effectiveness of malaria control interventions deployed in stable settings[36]reported that the cost-effectiveness of IRS compared to no IRS was US$ 840.44 per death averted and US$ 25.16 per DALY averted. The GDG noted that the cost-effectiveness of deploying IRS is likely to vary depending on the malaria transmission level in the area of deployment and other contextual factors. However, the GDG judged that IRS is likely to be cost-effective compared to no IRS, given the benefits of protecting vulnerable populations from malaria in such settings.

Acceptability No research was identified regarding the acceptability of IRS in emergency settings. Despite the lack of evidence, the GDG judged that IRS is likely to be acceptable to key stakeholders, given that IRS is generally accepted in more stable settings. Feasibility No evidence was included in the systematic review and no studies were identified by the GDG regarding the feasibility of implementing IRS in humanitarian emergency settings. The GDG judged that the feasibility of IRS would vary, likely depending on whether: - the structures in such settings are amenable to being sprayed; open-sided structures and certain surface materials would not be suitable for spraying; - commodities can be acquired and skilled personnel recruited with the resources available within the given timeframe; - access to the population is feasible, which may involve higher costs than in more stable settings. The GDG noted that IRS may be more feasible in the chronic phase of a humanitarian emergency, when shelter, general infrastructure and human resources are better established than in the acute stages. In the acute phase of an emergency, there may be other competing demands on resources and overall capacity. 71 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Justification The systematic review[55](Messenger et alunpublished evidence)included four studies conducted Pakistan and Sudan that compared IRS versus no IRS on malaria outcomes in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies. The review included only one observational study showing thatP. falciparumwas reduced, but the certainty of evidence was considered to be very low. One RCT showed no effect of IRS onP. falciparumparasite prevalence (low-certainty evidence). IRS was reported to reduce bothP. vivaxparasite incidence and prevalence based on two observational studies, but the certainty of evidence was assessed to be very low. All studies were conducted during the chronic phase of the emergency. Deploying IRS in the acute stage of an emergency may differ from employing IRS once some infrastructure has been established, due to numerous logistical challenges. Given that the systematic review only identified and included four studies, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined, and the generalizability of the findings was limited.Humanitarian emergencies in other parts of the world may differ in terms of available capacity, infrastructure, community behaviour and acceptance. As for many vector control interventions, the impact of IRS may vary in different settings depending on a number of factors, such as the behaviour of the mosquito species, the level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance in vectors, parasite prevalence, and coverage of IRS in the population.As with deploying IRS in more stable settings, IRS will only be effective", "page_start": 71, "page_end": 72, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The review findings provided little evidence of an impact on malaria outcomes in humanitarian emergencies. Given the effectiveness of IRS programmes in reducing malaria burden in more stable settings, however, the GDG judged that the desirable effects of deploying IRS compared to no IRS in humanitarian emergencies would likely outweigh the undesirable effects. Given the low certainty of the evidence, the panel felt that the recommendation should be classified as conditional. Considerations of feasibility and the cost and cost-effectiveness of implementing IRS in such settings were viewed by the GDG as important. In humanitarian emergencies, the shelters provided may not be amenable to spraying and there may be higher costs associated with deploying IRS in such settings than in more stable ones. Research needs WHO encourages funding of high-quality research to generate further evidence on: - the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of IRS in the acute phase of humanitarian emergencies (where logistics and priorities may differ); - contextual factors (i.e. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to IRS deployed in humanitarian emergencies. 4.1.2 Co-deploying ITNs and IRS Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Prioritize optimal coverage with either ITNs or IRS over combination (2019) The co-deployment of ITNs and IRS is not recommended for prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. Priority should be given to delivering either ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage and to a high standard, rather than introducing the second intervention as a means to compensate for deficiencies in the implementation of the first intervention. In settings where optimal ITN coverage, as specified in the strategic plan, has been achieved and where ITNs remain effective, additionally implementing IRS may have limited utility in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. Given the resource constraints across malaria endemic countries, it is recommended that effort be focused on good-quality implementation of either ITNs or IRS, rather than deploying both in the same area. However, the combination of these interventions may be considered for resistance prevention, mitigation or management should sufficient resources be available.

In many settings, a switch from ITNs to IRS or vice versa, rather than their combination, is likely to be the only financially feasible option. Deployment of either intervention needs to ensure optimal coverage of populations at risk of malaria and ensure they are delivered to a high standard. Further guidance on best practices for ensuring 72 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) high-quality deployment of interventions is provided in theOperational manual on indoor residual spraying: control of vectors of malaria, Aedes-borne diseases, Chagas disease, leishmaniases and lymphatic filariasis[66]and in theAlliance for Malaria Prevention toolkit. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms - No benefit of adding IRS to areas where pyrethroid-only ITNs are being used was identified in systematic review. - In areas of confirmed pyrethroid resistance, IRS with a non-pyrethroid insecticide may increase effectiveness against malaria. - No undesirable effects were identified in systematic review. However, the cost of combining two interventions will significantly increase commodity and operational costs. Certainty of the Moderate evidence The certainty of evidence identified in the systematic review showing no benefit to adding IRS in situations where ITNs are already being used was graded as moderate. Resources and - The degree of pyrethroid resistance and its impact on the effectiveness of pyrethroid-only ITNs other should be considered. considerations - The status of vector resistance to the proposed IRS active ingredient needs to be known. - In resource-constrained situations, it is unlikely to be financially feasible to deploy both ITNs and IRS. Justification The systematic review published in 2019[85]on the deployment of IRS in combination with ITNs (specifically pyrethroid-only LLINs) provided evidence that, in settings where there is optimal coverage with ITNs and where these remain effective, IRS may have limited utility in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. A systematic review comparing the impact of IRS to ITNs against malaria from a trial carried out in the United Republic of Tanzania reported variable results, and concluded that there was little difference between the two[86]. WHO guidance was developed accordingly to emphasize the need for good-quality implementation of either ITNs or IRS, rather than deploying both in the same area[87]. However, the co-deployment of these interventions may be considered for resistance prevention, mitigation or management should sufficient resources be available.

However, the co-deployment of these interventions may be considered for resistance prevention, mitigation or management should sufficient resources be available. Insecticide resistance threatens the effectiveness of insecticidal interventions and hence is a key consideration in determining which vector control interventions to select to ensure maximum impact. One approach to the prevention, mitigation and management of vector insecticide resistance is the co-deployment (or combination) of interventions with different insecticides (see Section 4.1 on “Prevention, mitigation and management of insecticide resistance”). Therefore, WHO guidance developed based on the systematic review[85]differentiates between the effect of combined interventions on malaria morbidity and mortality versus the utility of this approach in a resistance management strategy[87]. A summary of the conclusions (with minor updates for clarity) used to develop the above recommendations is as follows: - In settings with high ITN coverage where ITNsremain effective, IRS may have limited utility in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. However, IRS may be implemented as part of an IRM strategy in areas where ITNsare in use[21]. - Malaria control and elimination programmes should prioritize the delivery of ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage and to a high standard, rather than introducing the second intervention as a means to compensate for deficiencies in the implementation of the first intervention. - If ITNs and IRS are to be deployed together in the same geographical location, IRS should be conducted with a non- pyrethroid insecticide. - Evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of combining IRS and ITNs in malaria transmission foci, including in low transmission settings. Evidence is also needed from different eco-epidemiological settings outside of Africa. - All programmes in any transmission setting that decide to prioritize the combined deployment of ITNs and IRS over other potential use of their financial resources should include a rigorous programme of M&E (e.g. a stepped wedge introduction of the combination) in order to confirm whether the additional inputs are having the desired impact. Countries that are already using both interventions should similarly undertake an evaluation of the effectiveness of the combination versus either ITNs or IRS alone. 73 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - The approach of co-deploying interventions for resistance management was developed largely based on experience with agricultural pest management, and the evidence base from public health remains weak.

Practice Statement Access to ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage levels (2019) Access to effective vector control using ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage levels should be ensured forall populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings. Practical info Financial considerations such as cost and cost-effectiveness are major drivers of decision-making, and the selection of malaria vector control interventions and determination of their coverage should thus be embedded in a prioritization process that considers the cost and effectivenessof all available malaria interventions and aims at achieving maximum impact with the available resources. Evaluations of the relative cost and cost-effectiveness of ITNs and IRS are ongoing to inform revision of the guidelines. Justification ITNs can provide both personal and community-level protection when nets are deployed at the community rather than individual level, with the aim of providing sufficient nets to cover all household inhabitants. Similarly, IRS will have a greater effect on mosquito populations and therefore transmission if deployed at high coverage. It is therefore important to maximize access to ITNs or IRS in communities that are at risk of malaria. This will involve quantification of needs to enable access for all household inhabitants when placing procurement orders and putting in place appropriate delivery structures.For malaria vector control interventions recommended for large-scale deployment, namely ITNs and IRS, optimal coverage refers to providing populations at risk of malaria with access to ITNs coupled with health promotion to maximize use and ensuring timely replacement; or providing these populations with regular application of IRS. Either intervention should be deployed at a level that provides the best value for money while reflecting programmatic realities. In practice, this often means quantifying commodities to provide full access by the population at risk, while realizing that this will not result in 100% coverage or 100% access due to various system inefficiencies. Being cognizant of such constraints, decision-making should then consider other alternatives as part of the intervention package, ranging from chemoprevention to supplementary vector control, instead of pursuing the idealistic goal of providing full population coverage. In terms of the relative effectiveness of IRS compared to pyrethroid-only ITNs, a systematic review published in 2010[86]reported low-certainty evidence that, in areas of intense malaria transmission, IRS may be associated with lower malaria incidence, but no effect was evident for parasite prevalence. In areas of unstable transmission, ITNs may be associated with lower malaria incidence and prevalence; however, the certainty of evidence", "page_start": 74, "page_end": 74, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

In areas of unstable transmission, ITNs may be associated with lower malaria incidence and prevalence; however, the certainty of evidence was determined to be very low. The panel therefore could not provide a definitive conclusion on the comparative effectiveness of these interventions. WHO currently views these two interventions asbeing equally effective ways of delivering an insecticide. The actual effectiveness in reducing the burden of malaria is dependent on the insecticide(s) used on the ITN or applied by IRS.Decisions on whether to deploy IRS or ITNs need to be informed by a number of factors, such as data on insecticide resistance, past and present experience of using interventions (including feasibility of deployment and acceptability and use by end-users), vector behaviours and the current options availablewithin the context. Given these various considerations, the wide range of different contexts and the lack of correlation between insecticide resistance data assessed using bioassays and the actual effectiveness of an insecticidal intervention in controlling vectors, no general recommendation to guidethe selection of ITNs over IRS can be made. 74 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Practice Statement No scale-back in areas with ongoing local malaria transmission (2019) In areas with ongoing local malaria transmission (irrespective of both the pre-interventionand current level of transmission), vector control interventions should not be scaled back. Ensuring access to effective malaria vector control at optimal levels for allinhabitants of such areas should be pursued and maintained. Practical info Access to effective vector control interventions will need to be maintained in the majority of countries and locations where malaria control has been effective. This includes settings with ongoing malaria transmission, as well as those in which transmission has been interrupted but some level of receptivity and importation risk remains. Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of local transmission (reduction to zero incidence of indigenous cases) of a specified malaria parasite species in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate intervention activities. Following elimination, continued measures to prevent re- establishment of transmission are usually required[30]. Interventions are no longer required once eradication has been achieved. Malaria eradication is defined as the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by all human malaria parasite species as a result of deliberate activities. There is a critical need for all countries with ongoing malaria transmission, and in particular those approaching elimination, to build and maintain strong capacity in disease and entomological surveillance and health systems. The capacity to detect and respond to possible resurgences with appropriate vector control relies on having the necessary entomological information (i.e. susceptibility status of vectors", "page_start": 74, "page_end": 75, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

There is a critical need for all countries with ongoing malaria transmission, and in particular those approaching elimination, to build and maintain strong capacity in disease and entomological surveillance and health systems. The capacity to detect and respond to possible resurgences with appropriate vector control relies on having the necessary entomological information (i.e. susceptibility status of vectors to insecticides, as well as their biting and resting preferences). Such capacity is also required for the detailed assessment of malariogenic potential, which is a pre-condition for determining whether vector control can be scaled back (or focalized). If areas where transmission has been interrupted are identified, the decision to scale back vector control should be based on a detailed analysis that includes assessment of the receptivity and importation risk of the area, as well as an assessment of the active disease surveillance system, and capacity for case management and vector control response. Justification A comprehensive review of historical evidence and mathematical simulation modelling undertaken for WHO in 2015 indicated that the scale-back of malaria vector control was associated with a high probability of malaria resurgence, including for most scenarios in areas where malaria transmission was very low or had been interrupted[88]. Both the historical review and the simulation modelling clearly indicated that the risk of resurgence was significantly greater at higher EIRs and case importation rates, and lower coverage of active case detection and case management. Once transmission has been reduced to very low levels approaching elimination, ensuring optimal access to vector control for at- risk populations remains a priority, even though the size and demographics of the at-risk populations may change as malaria transmission is reduced. As malaria incidence falls and elimination is approached, increasing heterogeneity in transmission will result in foci with ongoing transmission in which vector control may need to be optimized and enhanced. Such foci may be the result of particularly high vectorial capacity, lapsed prevention and treatment services, changes in parasites that make the current strategies less effective, or reintroduction of malaria parasites by the movement of infected people or infected mosquitoes.Monitoring the coverage, quality and impact of vector control interventions is essential to maintain the effectiveness of control. Guidance on entomological surveillance across the continuum from control to elimination is provided elsewhere[30]. Once elimination has been achieved, vector control may need to be continued by targeting defined at-risk populations to prevent reintroduction or re-establishment of local transmission. It is acknowledged that malaria transmission can persist following the implementation of a widely effective malaria programme. The sources and risks of residual transmission may vary by location, time and the existing components of the current malaria programme. This variation is potentially due to a combination of both mosquito and human behaviours, such as when people live in or visit forest areas or do not sleep in protected houses, or when local mosquito vector species bite and/or", "page_start": 75, "page_end": 75, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Once elimination has been achieved, optimal vector control coverage should be maintained in receptive areas where there is a substantial risk of reintroduction. 75 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 4.1.3 Supplementary interventions Larval source management (LSM) LSM in the context of malaria control is the management of water bodies that are potential larval habitats for mosquitoes. Such management of water bodies is conducted to prevent the development of the immature stages (eggs, larvae and pupae) and hence the production of adult mosquitoes, with the overall aim of preventing or controlling transmission of malaria. There are four types of LSM: - habitat modification: a permanent alteration to the environment, e.g. land reclamation, filling of water bodies; - habitat manipulation: a recurrent activity, e.g. flushing of streams, drain clearance; - larviciding: the regular application of biological or chemical insecticides to water bodies; and - biological control: the introduction of natural predators into water bodies. Topical repellents and insecticide-treated clothing Topical repellents and insecticide-treated clothing have been proposed as potential methods for preventing malaria in areas where the mosquito vectors bite or rest outdoors, or bite in the early evening or early morning when people are not within housing structures. These methods have also been proposed for specific population groups, such as those who live or work away from permanent housing structures (e.g. migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, military personnel) or those who work outdoors at night. In these situations, the effectiveness of ITNs or IRS may be reduced. Repellents have also been proposed for use in high-risk groups, such as pregnant mothers. Despite the potential to provide individual protection against bites from malaria vectors, the deployment of the above personal protection methods in large-scale public health campaigns has been limited, at least partially due to the scarcity of evidence of their public health value. Daily compliance and appropriate use of repellents seem to be major obstacles to achieving such potential impact[89][90].Individuals’ use of the intervention to achieve personal protection faces the same obstacles. Spatial emanators Spatial emanators, also called spatial repellents, are a category of vector control interventions designed to reduce human exposure to disease-carrying mosquitoes by dispersing volatile active ingredients into the surrounding air. These interventions function by deterring mosquitoes from entering a treated space and/or disrupting their ability to locate and bite human hosts.

These interventions function by deterring mosquitoes from entering a treated space and/or disrupting their ability to locate and bite human hosts. Spatial emanators may be deployed as a supplementary measure alongside established vector control strategies, such as ITNs and IRS, particularly in settings where these primary interventions face limitations, such as in humanitarian emergencies. Spatial emanators can be broadly categorized into passive and active types based on their method of dispersal. Passive emanators, such as volatile pyrethroid-based devices, release active ingredients at ambient temperatures and rely on natural air movement for dispersal of the active ingredient, without the need for heat or electricity. By contrast, active emanators, including mosquito coils, liquid electrics and vaporizing mats, rely on daily activation by end-users and/or a source of electricity, which may not be continuously available to populations most at risk of malaria. Active emanators are already being used by some households, particularly in regions where mosquitoes exhibit outdoor or early-evening biting behaviours that reduce the efficacy of IRS and ITNs. Among spatial emanators, mosquito coils are the most widely used household insecticidal product globally, with billions of units sold each year. Coils containing pyrethroid-based compounds such as transfluthrin and metofluthrin have demonstrated the ability to deter mosquitoes and, in some cases, reduce malaria transmission. Passive emanators may provide a long-lasting effect without requiring combustion or electricity, making them suitable for continuous protection indoors or in semi-enclosed spaces. Previous evaluations of spatial emanators highlighted the need for further evidence to support their use for malaria control. A 2019 review[89]determined that, while these interventions showed promise in reducing mosquito bites, the available data were insufficient to warrant a formal recommendation. However, recent studies have provided new insights into the potential role of spatial emanators in integrated vector management. To date, preliminary research has considered spatial emanators to provide the following benefits: - They are easy to use: Deployment of spatial emanators requires minimal user effort (compared to ITNs) and minimal training for deployment (compared to IRS). - They require low personal compliance: Spatial emanators do not require high levels of daily personal compliance. - They are easily deployable: Products are designed to be lightweight and portable, facilitating rapid deployment and scalability in diverse settings, which may include nomadic or unstable housing conditions. 76 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Space spraying Space spraying refers to the release of fast-acting insecticides into the air as smoke or as fine droplets as a method to reduce the numbers of adult mosquitoes in dwellings and also outdoors.

Application methods include thermal fogging; cold aerosol distribution by handheld or backpack sprayers, ground vehicles or aerial means; and repetitious spraying by two or more sprays in quick succession. Space spraying is most often deployed in response to epidemics or outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease, such as dengue. Housing modifications In the context of malaria control, housing modifications are defined as any structural changes, pre- or post-construction, of a house that prevents the entry of mosquitoes and/or decreases exposure of inhabitants to vectors with the aim of preventing or reducing the transmission of malaria. Housing modifications may encompass a wide range of interventions– from those made at the outset in the structural design of the house and the choice of materials used, to modifications made to existing homes, such as the screening or closure of gaps. In 2018, the WHO Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health published the WHOHousing and health guidelines[91]. This document brings together the most recent evidence to provide practical recommendations for reducing the health burden due to unsafe and substandard housing. The review concluded that improved housing conditions have the potential to save lives, prevent disease, increase quality of life, reduce poverty, and help mitigate climate change. It was, however, noted that further evidence was needed on the impact of improved housing in preventing vector-borne diseases. Available evidence indicates that poor-quality housing and neglected peri-domestic environments are risk factors for the transmission of a number of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, arboviral diseases (e.g. dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika virus disease), Chagas disease and leishmaniasis[92]. Together with metal roofs, ceilings, and finished interior walls, the closing of open eaves, screening of doors and windows with fly screens or mosquito netting, and filling of holes and cracks in walls and roofs may reduce the mosquitoes’ entry points into houses and potentially reduce transmission of malaria and other vector- borne diseases. A recent review indicated that housing quality is an important risk factor for malaria infection across the spectrum of malaria endemicity in sub-Saharan Africa[93]. Structural housing interventions that may reduce exposure of inhabitants to mosquitoes fall largely into two categories: 1.

Housing modifications are likely to be most effective against mosquitoes that display endophilic and/or endophagic behaviours (i.e. indoor resting and feeding, respectively). 77 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Larviciding (2019) Insecticides can be regularly applied to water bodies (larviciding) for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults as a supplementary intervention to ITNs or IRS in areas with ongoing malaria transmission where aquatic habitats are few, fixed and findable. The conditionality of this recommendation is due to the low certainty of evidence, the impact being limited to non-extensive habitats, and concerns about feasibility. When considering larviciding, programmes should note the following: - Larviciding only reduces vector density and so does not have the same potential for health impact as ITNs and IRS; ITNs provide protection from biting vectors and both ITNs and IRS reduce adult longevity. - Larviciding should not be seen as a substitute for ITNs or IRS or a means to fill a coverage gap in areas with significant malaria risk; rather, larviciding represents a potential supplementary strategy for malaria control. - Feasibility and cost-effectiveness should be taken into account; larviciding will generally be most cost-effective in areas where larval habitats are few, fixed and findable, and likely less feasible in areas where the aquatic habitats are abundant, scattered and variable. The following settings are potentially the most suitable for larviciding as a supplementary measure implemented alongside ITNs or IRS: - urban areas, where breeding sites are relatively few, fixed and findable in relation to houses (which are targeted for ITNs or IRS); and - arid regions, where larval habitats may be few and fixed throughout much of the year. Practical info Larviciding is most likely to be cost-effective in urban areas where the appropriate conditions are more likely to be present. Larviciding is not generally recommended in rural settings, unless there are particular circumstances limiting the larval habitats and specific evidence confirming that such measures can reduce malaria incidence in the local setting. Determining whether or not specific habitats have immatureAnopheleslarvae and are suitable for larviciding is essential and should be based on expert technical opinion and knowledge.

Larviciding will generally be most effective in areas where larval habitats are few, fixed and findable, and likely less feasible in areas where the aquatic habitats are abundant, scattered and variable. Determination of whether or not specific habitats are suitable for larviciding should be based on assessment by an entomologist. The WHO operational manual focuses on sub-Saharan Africa, but the principles espoused are likely to hold for other geographic regions that fit the same criteria. The following settings are potentially the most suitable for larviciding as a supplementary measure implemented alongside ITNs or IRS: - urban areas, where breeding sites are relatively few, fixed and findable in relation to houses (which are targeted for ITNs or IRS); and - arid regions, where larval habitats may be few and fixed throughout much of the year. Larviciding is likely to be more acceptable in communities that have a good understanding of the lifecycle of mosquitoes and the link with the transmission of malaria or other diseases. Community members may have concerns about larvicides being applied to drinking water or other domestic water sources. A well-designed community sensitization programme is required to ensure that communities fully understand the intervention and that any concerns about health and safety aspects are addressed. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review[97]reported that larviciding for non‐extensive larval habitats less than 1km2may have an effect in reducing malaria incidence (rate ratio: 0.24; one trial; low-certainty evidence) and parasite prevalence (risk ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71–0.89; two studies; low-certainty evidence) compared to no larviciding. However, it is not knownwhether larviciding has an effect on malaria incidence(OR: 1.97; 78 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 95% CI: 1.39–2.81; one study; very low-certainty evidence) or parasite prevalence(OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.45–4.93; one study; very low-certainty evidence) compared to no larvicidingin large‐scale aquatic habitats. No undesirable effects were identified in the systematic review. However, larviciding may affect non-target fauna; communities may not accept its application to sources of drinking water or water used for other domestic purposes.

However, the systematic review on larviciding conducted in 2019[97]assessed that the certainty of evidence of impact on malaria incidence or parasite prevalence was moderate or low in non-extensive habitats. Since larviciding only reduces vector density, it does not have the same potential for health impact as ITNs and IRS – both of which reduce vector longevity (a key determinant of transmission intensity) and provide protection from biting vectors. As a result, larviciding should never be seen as a substitute for ITNs or IRS in areas with significant malaria risk.

Larval habitat modification and/or larval habitat manipulation (2021) No recommendation can be made because the evidence on the effectiveness of a specific larval habitat modification and/or larval habitat manipulation intervention for the prevention and control of malaria was deemed to be insufficient. Practical info Although the available evidence that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review was considered insufficient to develop specific recommendations, national programmes may decide to use environmental management (habitat modification and/or manipulation) to avoid the creation, and reduce the availability of, larval habitats, where deemed appropriate based on expert guidance and local knowledge. If such strategies are employed, the selection of the specific intervention(s) should be highly contextual, i.e. it should take into account the specific environment, the types of interventions relevant to that environment, the resources needed and their availability, the feasibility of the intervention(s), acceptability by local stakeholders and potential impact on equity. The selection should also take into account previous experience either gained locally or from other areas of similar ecological and epidemiological characteristics where such intervention(s) have been implemented. Additionally, the selection of the comparator should consider other interventions that are known to be cost-effective, for example, larviciding. Where the decision is taken to invest resources into larval habitat modification and/or larval habitat manipulation, the intervention(s) should be designed and conducted with the explicit aim of generating data to demonstrate effective malaria control, preferably supported with environmental and entomological data as secondary end-points. When assessing the impact of environmental management against malaria, it is important that the testing of the intervention(s) under investigation be conducted specifically for the purpose of preventing or controlling malaria by reducing the availability and productivity of larval habitats. For example, dams are generally constructed for water management, irrigation or power production purposes, not for malaria control. In fact, in some cases, their construction may result in increased larval production due to the creation of standing water bodies. The controlled release of water from the impoundment of a dam, however, is considered an example of habitat manipulation – a recurrent activity that potentially controls mosquito larvae by increasing the flow rate of downstream water with the aim of preventing mosquito development and so controlling malaria transmission. This is one example of the multitude of interventions that fall under the broad category of larval habitat modification and/or manipulation.

To be able to 80 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) generate evidence on the efficacy of larval habitat modification and/or manipulation in preventing malaria, and to facilitate the interpretation of the evidence once generated, it is important to well define the interventions that are being evaluated and, importantly, compare how the water conditions of larval habitats at the intervention and control sites are affected. For example, if the intervention aimed to increase the water flow to downstream areas, the evaluation should include an assessment of whether this was achieved, the extent to which this impacted the development of the immature and adult stages of the mosquito, and, ultimately, whether there was an epidemiological impact against malaria in the intervention arms compared to control areas. This information will then support the evolution of WHO guidance in this area and, ultimately, guide the choice and implementation of efficacious interventions. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review (Martelloet alunpublished evidence) identified two studies that investigated the impact of habitat manipulation by controlling the release of water from flood gates of dams or spillways (overflow channels) across streams to flush downstream areas with water against malaria. It is unknown whether larval habitat manipulation has an effect on malaria parasite prevalence compared to no larval habitat manipulation(relative risk: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.0–0.16; one study; very low-certainty evidence). It is unknown whether larval habitat manipulation combined with IRS has an effect on malaria clinical incidence compared to IRS alone(odds ratios or relative risks could not be calculated because the numbers of participants in each arm or at follow-up were not reported; one study; very low-certainty evidence). Both studies were conducted in very specific settings. No undesirable effects were identified in the systematic review. Certainty of the Very low evidence The systematic review assessed that the overall certainty of evidence that larval habitat manipulation had an impact on malaria was very low.

The studies provided low- or very low-certainty evidence that the controlled release of water from flood gates of dams to discharge excess water or using spillways (overflow channels) across streams to automatically flush downstream areas with water (continually or intermittently) reduced clinical malaria incidence or parasite prevalence. The evidence was downgraded due to the lack of appropriate randomization or poor statistical reporting. The studies examined very specific interventions, each studied in a single site, which the GDG judged would limit their generalizability. The systematic review reported a number of other studies with only entomological outcomes investigating a wide range of highly heterogeneous interventions falling under the broad term of larval habitat manipulation and/or modification, some of which may only be appropriate in specific ecologies. Given the broad range of interventions and settings in which larval habitat manipulation and/or modification may be applied, the GDG judged that the potential impact, feasibility, acceptability and resource needs for each intervention are likely to be highly variable. Although it is acknowledged that there is a wealth of historical research on environmental management of malaria, the literature did not meet the eligibility criteria to be included in this systematic review. Therefore, there remains a continued need to robustly 81 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) demonstrate the epidemiological impact of environmental management (habitat modification and/or manipulation) on malaria incidence and prevalence through further well-designed intervention studies. Research needs The GDG encourages funding of high-quality research on the impact of habitat manipulation and/or modification on malaria transmission to inform the development of specific WHO recommendations in this area. A number of evidence gaps and associated requirements were identified: - Determine the impact (incidence of clinical malaria and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/ unintended consequences of the different interventions. - Epidemiological evidence is required on the efficacy against malaria of the same intervention implemented in different settings (where vector species may differ). - Detailed descriptions are needed of the interventions deployed, as well as larval habitat types and vector species targeted. The impact of the intervention on the water conditions of the larval habitats should be assessed, i.e. properties of the habitat that the intervention aims to modify such as water flow, volume, sunlight penetration, salinity or other physical conditions. - Evidence is needed on contextual factors, (i.e. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to larval habitat modification and/or manipulation is needed.

Larvivorous fish (2019) No recommendation can be made because no evidence on the effectiveness of larvivorous fish for the prevention and control of malaria was identified. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms No studies reporting epidemiological outcomes against malaria were identified in the systematic review[107]. The review reported that there was no clear evidence of an effect on larval densities (very low-certainty evidence), but larvivorous fish may reduce the number of habitats positive for anopheline larvae (low-certainty evidence). The GDG noted that fish can serve as an additional source of nutrition. No undesirable effects were identified in the systematic review. The GDG recognized that there are specific settings in which the intervention is currently implemented, and in these specific settings programme staff consider it to be effective.

Justification The systematic review conducted in 2017 on the use of larvivorous fish[103]did not identify any studies demonstrating impact on malaria and so there is insufficient evidence to support a recommendation. The GDG recognized that there are specific settings in which the intervention is currently implemented, and in these specific settings programme staff consider it to be effective. In some of the settings where larvivorous fish are being deployed, programmatic evidence exists; however, this was not determined appropriate for inclusion in the systematic review due to unsuitable study design or other concerns. The GDG acknowledged that there may be data at the country/programme level that it is not aware of.

Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review[90]included eight studies that measured the impact of deploying topical repellents in communities in terms of malaria outcomes. However, only six of these were included in the meta-analysis (five cRCTs and one RCT). Two studies were included in the narrative synthesis but excluded from the meta-analysis, because the authors were unable to extract the data for their inclusion in the latter. Studies were carried out among residents of all ages in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Cambodia, Ecuador, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Peru and the United Republic of Tanzania, and in specific populations in Pakistan and Thailand (refugees). None of the studies carried out wherePlasmodium vivaxwas being transmitted cleared infections at the start and so only outcomes for P. falciparumwere included. Effect on malaria incidence Four studies (three cRCTs and one RCT) reported the effect of topical repellents on malaria incidence. Three of them measured infection incidence six months after deploying topical repellents, and one study reported case incidence after 12 months. No significant reductions in infection and case incidence were seen with the use of topical repellents (infection IRR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.56–1.02; low-certainty evidence; case IRR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.32–1.36; low-certainty evidence). Combining the studies showed a small but significant effect on malaria case incidence and infection incidence (IRR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56–0.98; low- certainty evidence). Effect on malaria prevalence Four studies (three cRCTs and one RCT) reported the effect of topical repellents on malaria prevalence and showed that their use was associated with a significant effect (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67–0.97; low- certainty evidence). Effects in high-risk groups Subgroup analyses were carried out to compare high-risk groups and non-high-risk groups in terms of the effect of topical repellents on malaria incidence and prevalence outcomes. A non-significant reduction in malaria incidence was observed based on three studies carried out in high-risk populations (IRR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.58–1.01).

Effects in individually randomized studies Subgroup analyses indicated no significant effect on malaria incidence when participants were individually randomized to treatment arms (IRR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49–1.04) or when randomization took place at the cluster level (IRR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.51–1.18); however, only a small number of studies were included. 83 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) The GDG concluded that further evidence is needed to show a significant impact against malaria for communities receiving topical repellents. They also noted that the lack of evidence of an impact against malaria in many of the studies could be attributed to low individual compliance to topical repellents and/or insufficient regular application of the product. Adverse events A total of 283 adverse events (0.6%) were reported from the cRCT and RCT studies, with all events relating to mild skin irritation. The GDG judged these to be few and mild. Certainty of the Low evidence The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be low. Values and No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably preferences no important uncertainty or variability. Resources No research was identified that assessed cost, cost-effectiveness or resource needs. Equity No studies were identified that addressed the issue of whether topical repellents increased or decreased health equity. Acceptability Although the systematic review did not report the acceptability of topical repellents, levels of adherence to intervention estimates were included. In general, adherence was heterogeneous and varied depending on how it was assessed. Methods included self-reporting by participants, observations by study staff and a combination of the two in some studies. Observation methods varied from estimating the weight of returned repellent bottles, counting the number of bottles issued and randomly smelling participants’ skin to determine whether the repellent had been applied. Three studies reported very high adherence in the intervention group (90–98%); however, comparisons between self-reported and observed adherence levels showed large differences, with generally higher self-reported rates.

The GDG noted that adherence to topical repellents with regular and adequate application is likely to be required for impact against malaria. Feasibility No evidence was included in the review regarding how feasible it would be to deploy topical repellents. Justification The systematic review[90]looked at the protective effect of topical repellents reported in terms of overall incidence or prevalence of malaria in those communities that received topical repellents and in individuals who were randomly assigned to receive them. However, only a single study was identified that randomly assigned topical repellents to individuals and no significant impact against malaria incidence was reported. For this study and most of the community-randomized studies included in the review, adherence to the topical repellent was reported to be low. More studies are needed to assess whether topical repellents confer individual protection against malaria, where outcomes are linked to adequate application of topical repellents (i.e. regular application in sufficient amounts to exposed skin). The effect of topical repellents on individuals can sometimes be identified in community-randomized studies by comparing the individuals assigned to the intervention who adhered to the assignment and used the product and those who were assigned to not use the product and therefore did not use it. Such analyses, generally termed “per-protocol” analyses, could be examined to better contextualize the individual benefits of topical repellents, even when the overarching trial goals were to provide evidence on community-level impact. 84 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) For studies in which treatment arms were randomized at the cluster or community level, the systematic review reported no significant effect of topical repellents in terms of reducingP. falciparuminfection incidence or case incidence when these outcomes were evaluated separately (infection IRR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.56–1.02; low-certainty evidence; case IRR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.32–1.36; low-certainty evidence). Combining data from these few studies showed a small but significant effect on malaria incidence (combined case and infection IRR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56–0.98); however, the certainty of evidence was graded as low. A significant effect of topical repellents was observed against malaria prevalence (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67–0.97); however, the certainty of evidence was graded as low due to concerns over risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness present in the studies included. The review reported that any protective effect was likely driven by two large studies that were included in the analysis; these were carried out in refugee camps where the populations did not have access to ITNs.

The GDG concluded that while topical repellents have been shown to prevent mosquito bites, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether they have an effect on malaria at the community or individual level. Further studies are needed to determine whether populations in specific settings and those determined to be at high risk for malaria may benefit from topical repellents. Research needs WHO encourages additional high-quality research to generate further evidence on: - the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of topical repellents for populations determined to be “high-risk”, such as migrants, refugees, forest goers, military, those who sleep outdoors, etc.; - the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of topical repellents for individuals who use repellents; - the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of topical repellents for populations living in African settings; - the impact againstP. vivaxmalaria (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of topical repellents; and - contextual factors (e.g. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to the use of topical repellents. Conditional recommendation against , Low certainty evidence Insecticide-treated clothing (2019) Deployment of insecticide-treated clothing is not recommended for the prevention and control of malaria at the community level in areas with ongoing malaria transmission; however, insecticide-treated clothing may be beneficial as an intervention to provide personal protection against malaria in specific population groups. The GDG recommended against the deployment of insecticide-treated clothing due to the lack of evidence of an impact in the general population.In the absence of ITNs, there is some evidence that insecticide‐treated clothing may reduce the risk of malaria infection in specific populations such as refugees and military personnel.

Resources and Such clothing may be beneficial as a tool to provide personal protection against malaria in specific other population groups (refugees, military personnel). considerations Justification The systematic review carried out in 2018[89]provided low-certainty evidence that insecticide-treated clothing may have protective efficacy againstP. falciparumandP. vivaxcases, at least in certain specific populations (refugees, military personnel and others engaged in occupations that place them at high risk) and where ITNs are not in use.There was no evidence available on epidemiological effects in the general at-risk population. Research needs - Determine the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/ unintended consequences of insecticide-treated clothing in the general population. - Identify approaches to enhance acceptability/desirability and increase uptake and adherence. - Develop formulations that improve the durability of insecticidal efficacy. New Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Spatial emanators (2025) Spatial emanatorscan be deployedfor the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. The conditionality of the recommendation to deploy spatial repellents is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of desirable and undesirable effects probably favours deployment alongside ITNs or IRS, but considers that the systematic review found considerable heterogeneity in protective effect, largely explained by different levels of coverage achieved with the spatial repellent in each trial. The GDG therefore noted that effective protection of the population with spatial repellents depends on continuous high coverage in the target area, with duration of efficacy of the product and distribution model being the key determinants of feasibility and cost-effectiveness. In deciding whether to deploy spatial emanators as a supplementary intervention, malaria programmes should: - ensure that targeted coverage levels of interventions recommended for large-scale deployment (ITNs, IRS) are achieved and sustained; - determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra costs, especially given the residual efficacy of the specific spatial repellent product under consideration; - generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g. stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as local vector susceptibility to the active", "page_start": 85, "page_end": 86, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Practical info Several resource requirements have been identified that may be useful to consider before deploying spatial emanators as part of a coordinated deployment strategy. The distribution of spatial emanators involves several logistical and financial considerations. Transportation and storage costs, especially in remote or rural areas, can have a significant impact on overall expenses. Customs and import fees may further increase costs when importing spatial emanators into malaria-endemic regions. Effective distribution relies on community-based delivery systems, such as health workers, local vendors or clinics, to ensure broad access and uptake. These systems require investment in both infrastructure and personnel to maintain a steady supply of products. In addition, implementation costs may include initial programme set-up expenses, such as training and education, as well as recurring 86 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) operational costs for product replacement and redistribution. Because spatial emanators often require regular replacement, their long-term affordability may depend on sustained financial and programmatic support. Integrating spatial emanators with existing vector control tools, such as ITNs and IRS, may also incur costs related to programme coordination and outreach efforts. Beyond distribution and implementation, monitoring and evaluation will be essential to assess the effectiveness of spatial emanators in further reducing malaria transmission. Appropriate metrics of coverage will need to be determined. Community feedback systems should track user acceptance and adherence. Regular programme oversight will ensure that existing interventions (e.g. ITNs and IRS) remain effective and appropriately distributed/applied. Overall, the feasibility of spatial emanators will depend not only on the direct costs but also on sustained investment in monitoring, education and integration with existing malaria control activities. Any deployment strategy will need to account for product-specific manufacturing instructions, in particular the intended duration of efficacy and number of units required per unit area. Disposal and waste management should be considered. In deciding whether to deploy spatial emanators, control programmes should consider the available resources and ensure that spatial emanators are not deployed at the expense of ITN distribution or continued IRS programmes.

Additional evidence is needed before WHO would be able to support a recommendation for the replacement of interventions for wide scale deployment with spatial emanators. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms This systematic review (Barker et al,unpublished evidence) investigated the effectiveness of spatial emanators in preventing malaria compared to placebo emanators or standard of care. The systematic review reported on six trials that evaluated the impact of spatial emanators used indoors on malaria. Two trials assessed coils, while four assessed passive emanators. One of these passive emanator trials evaluated passive emanators againstAedes-borne virus infections, but it was included for the outcomes of adverse effects, as the trial evaluated the same product as that used in the other trials. The impact of spatial emanators were measured using passive emanators and mosquito coils. Malaria incidence was measured in four trials (three assessing passive emanators, one assessing coils) and showed an overall reduction of malaria incidence. This effect, however, depended on intervention coverage: - Overall, spatial emanators resulted in 472 fewer cases of malaria per 1 000 people exposed to the intervention (903 fewer to 103 more cases; rate ratio: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.56–1.05; four trials; low- certainty evidence, downgraded due to variability in intervention coverage, and study settings). - When community coverage of the intervention was ≥ 80%, there were 274 fewer cases of malaria per 1000 people exposed to spatial emanators (365 fewer to 158 fewer; rate ratio: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.56–0.81; two trials; high-certainty evidence). By contrast, when coverage was < 80%, there was little detectable difference from the control group (rate ratio: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.97–1.08; one trial; moderate-certainty evidence), suggesting that high levels of intervention coverage are essential. The key conclusion was that spatial emanators are effective at reducing malaria cases, and the protective effect is dependent on high community coverage. Parasite prevalence was assessed exclusively in trials that evaluated mosquito coils, with results as follows: - P. falciparumprevalence: Spatial emanators compared to control settings resulted in a slight reduction in parasite prevalence of 2.6 fewer cases per 1000 people (from 3 fewer cases to 1.7 fewer cases; OR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.11–0.49; one trial; moderate-certainty evidence). - P. vivaxprevalence: The same study found that there was a similar reduction in P. vivax prevalence of 2.7 fewer cases per 1000 people (from 3 fewer cases to 1.9 fewer cases; OR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.09–0.44; one trial; moderate-certainty evidence). These results highlight that spatial emanators (coils) can reduce parasite prevalence, particularly in areas with high coverage. 87 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) While spatial emanators demonstrated benefits in terms of malaria reduction, potential harms and uncertainties were also", "page_start": 87, "page_end": 88, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

In terms of all-cause mortality, there is probably little to no difference in deaths when comparing spatial emanators to controls: four more deaths per 1000 people (from 2 fewer deaths to 40 more deaths; risk ratio = 2.35; 95% CI: 0.41–13.32; one trial; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to the low number of events and underpowered, small sample size for this outcome). The included trial reported deaths due to various causes (e.g. respiratory infections, drowning, unknown factors), but none were directly linked to spatial emanator exposure. For adverse events, there is probably little to no difference between intervention and control groups in terms of adverse effects: 12 fewer adverse effects per 1 000 people (from 68 fewer to 59 more; risk ratio = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.77–1.20; four trials; moderate-certainty evidence). No severe adverse effects were reported and associated with the intervention being evaluated. Common concerns related to long-term exposure include respiratory irritation from spatial emanators. Some of the adverse effects reported included breathing issues, headaches, allergic reactions and skin irritations; however, adverse effects were not systematically reported across all trials. Potential risks were identified through the systematic review, including: - Diversion of mosquitoes: Some trials reported concerns that non-users might experience increased mosquito-biting rates due to repelled mosquitoes being pushed into untreated areas. - Environmental concerns: Waste management and disposal of used emanators and coils require further evaluation, as improper disposal could contribute to insecticide resistance and/or environmental contamination. - Safety: As mosquito coils are burned, they may pose a fire hazard in homes. The health impact of regular use of mosquito coils may require further assessment due to increased exposure to the active ingredient and other components of the coil. - Misuse: Some users may rely on spatial emanators as a sole intervention while neglecting primary interventions; however, use of spatial emanators as a stand-alone intervention has not been assessed. In some countries, the registration of mosquito coils does not allow for indoor use. - Resistance: Continued use of spatial emanators may result in selection for insecticide resistance. In summary, there was moderate- to high-certainty evidence supporting that spatial emanators reduce malaria incidence andPlasmodiumprevalence, particularly with high coverage and when used in addition to ITNs. No major safety concerns were identified. Potential risks include mosquito diversion, environmental waste, fire hazards and insecticide resistance.

The balance of effects probably favours the intervention. Certainty of the Moderate evidence The overall certainty of the evidence supporting the effectiveness of spatial emanators used indoors was rated as moderate, owing to numerous missing outcomes, and low certainty evidence for some of the more important outcomes. Some variability was also observed, depending on the outcome assessed. The certainty rating was based on the GRADE framework, considering factors such as risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision and publication bias. The primary reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence were observed heterogeneity in spatial emanator coverage levels (which likely influence effectiveness) between the studies. Furthermore, estimates were imprecise, with wide CIs for some key outcomes indicating considerable uncertainty. This was especially the case for the impact of spatial emanators on mortality and severe malaria, as these outcomes were rare and studies were not powered to detect a difference. The GDG also acknowledged that several research gaps remain. Values and For the outcomes included in the systematic review – mortality, prevalence of parasitaemia, incidence of preferences malaria, incidence of severe disease, adverse effects – no specific research evidence was presented on the degree to which patients, their families and health care providers value these outcomes. 88 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Nevertheless, outcomes such as reductions in malaria morbidity, mortality and severe disease prevention are likely to be valued. While there has been no research directly evaluating the degree to which individuals value specific outcomes, such as reduction of malaria incidence or parasite prevalence, indirect evidence suggests that there is high acceptability and perceived effectiveness among users. Communities may prioritize immediate, visible benefits (such as reduced mosquito bites) over longer term impacts on malaria transmission. Resources The deployment of spatial emanators entails a range of financial and logistical considerations, including costs associated with production, distribution, implementation, monitoring and long-term sustainability. Insights from the deliberations of the GDG, along with findings from the systematic review, provide an overview of the economic and programmatic feasibility of these interventions. While spatial emanators offer an additional tool for malaria control, their financial sustainability and cost-effectiveness require further investigation. The GDG assessed the resource requirements for spatial emanators as representing \"moderate costs\", although there is significant variability depending on the setting in which they are deployed. The financial burden of spatial emanator programmes comprises several key components. First, distribution costs involve transportation, supply chain management and import fees, which may fluctuate based on geographical location and regulatory requirements.

Second, implementation costs are another major consideration, encompassing expenditures for training of personnel, operational expenses and product replacement. Finally, monitoring and evaluation costs include the assessment of intervention effectiveness and the development of community feedback systems to ensure continuous programme improvement. It is important to note that production costs were excluded from these considerations due to the variability of costs with the formulation of the active ingredient used and the scale of production by the manufacturer. General affordability remains a central concern, particularly in low-income settings. Many malaria- endemic regions rely on subsidized interventions such as ITNs and IRS, raising questions about whether spatial emanators can be effectively integrated into existing control programme budgets. In such cases, securing external funding or integrating spatial emanators into broader vector control initiatives may be necessary to ensure equitable access and sustainability. Despite the potential of spatial emanators as an effective intervention, the systematic review was unable to include any formal cost-effectiveness studies. While preliminary economic models have been published, further investigation is needed to comprehensively assess the variability among emanators and coils, contextual factors, and impact in different transmission contexts, among other aspects. The cost of spatial repellents must be considered in relation to alternative interventions. Mosquito coils, for example, remain a widely used low-cost alternative in many malaria-endemic regions. However, the cumulative costs of frequent replacement may surpass the cost of ITNs in the long term. These factors emphasize the importance of selecting interventions that offer both affordability and sustainability. A major source of uncertainty in assessing the costs of spatial emanators is related to product lifespan. The longevity of a spatial emanator directly influences its cost-effectiveness. Shorter duration products require frequent replacement, which increases both the financial costs and logistical burden. For example, a spatial emanator product requiring replacement every 28 days would cost more (in terms of both raw materials and operational deployment) than a longer duration alternative. Moreover, emanators with a lifespan of 12 months or more would reduce the need for frequent replacement, thereby lowering long-term costs and simplifying programme management. Contextual factors also play a crucial role in determining the financial and logistical feasibility of spatial repellent programmes. The number of units required per household, influenced by housing layout and density, can significantly impact costs, but may also make the intervention more economical where there are many people living within a single space. There remain critical research gaps that must be addressed to refine cost-effectiveness estimates and inform policy decisions. To date, no studies have directly calculated the additive and synergistic effects of spatial emanators alone and in combination with ITNs and IRS in order to fully understand the potential cost-effectiveness under different scenarios.

Until such research is conducted, it will be difficult to determine the relative value of spatial emanators within malaria control activities. In addition, more data are needed on optimal distribution models, particularly how costs scale in different geographical and 89 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) economic contexts. Understanding the peak impact levels achievable through various coverage scenarios will help policy-makers to allocate resources effectively and maximize the benefits of spatial emanator deployment. In conclusion, while the resource requirements for spatial emanators compared to no intervention were considered to result in a moderate increase in costs, their costs vary considerably depending on product choice, product lifespan, distribution logistics and the scale of implementation in different settings. Cost- effectiveness remains uncertain, with preliminary models indicating potential financial benefits when spatial emanators are deployed at high coverage levels. However, additional research is required to refine cost estimates, explore sustainable financing options and evaluate the long-term economic impact of integrating spatial emanators into national malaria strategies. Until these questions are fully addressed, large-scale policy recommendations on spatial emanators must be made with caution, ensuring that financial and operational feasibility is fully considered in the broader context of malaria prevention. Cost-effectiveness No specific study was commissioned to address this question. The GDG considered, however, that there were numerous factors that might influence cost-effectiveness, including theinitial cost of the product,theduration of efficacy and required frequency of replacement of the product, the number of products required to effectively cover a household, and the integration of the deployment approach with existing programmatic work (inferring scalability). Cost-effectiveness may also be influenced by the incremental costs and synergies associated with complementary vector control implementation approaches within a community (e.g. IRS, ITNs), the duration of product efficacy and whether the intervention is used in high or low transmission settings. Equity The equity implications of spatial emanators were a key focus of the GDG discussions. The GDG considered that these emanators would potentially enhance malaria prevention by reaching populations underserved by standard interventions such as ITNs and IRS. However, their impact depends on accessibility, affordability and integration into national programmes. Gender and disability considerations are essential in malaria prevention. Cultural norms often limit women’s decision-making on ITN or IRS use, making it vital to ensure equal access to spatial emanators, as these devices are designed to protect everyone (including women and children) within the shared space.

Furthermore, unlike ITNs, which require nightly use, and IRS, which relies on external implementation, spatial emanators may offer passive protection with fewer installation or application challenges, to persons with disabilities and/or mobility limitations. To enhance equity, spatial emanators may be incorporated into national malaria control strategies, ensuring that vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, children, older adults and individuals with limited mobility can benefit effectively without financial or logistical challenges. Spatial emanators may also offer protection to groups that are often missed by current prevention efforts, such as individuals who work outdoors, communities with housing that limits the effectiveness of IRS, and those in remote areas. Therefore, targeted distribution efforts may prioritize these underserved groups. However, equitable access goes beyond distribution alone; it also requires educational campaigns to be accessible and inclusive. To maximize uptake, awareness efforts must accommodate diverse needs by using formats such as Braille and sign language, as well as culturally and linguistically appropriate communication strategies that incorporate visual aids, audio materials and gender-sensitive messaging. Affordability potentially remains a barrier to accessibility should individuals have to cover some of the costs of the devices. While studies in Cambodia indicate high acceptance, many people reportedly would not replace ITNs with spatial emanators due to cost. The average willingness-to-pay was US$0.30 per unit, highlighting the need for subsidies, financing or inclusion in national programmes and thus programmatic roll-out. Free distribution would enhance equity by ensuring that cost does not become a barrier for low-income groups, whereas co-payment models risk excluding the most vulnerable populations. Furthermore, if funding is diverted from ITNs or IRS, overall malaria prevention coverage could be compromised; therefore, further studies are needed to better understand the additive and/or synergistic effects of spatial emanators when used either in combination with or instead of IRS and ITNs. This evidence will be important for ensuring data-driven/evidence-based decision-making processes.

However, achieving this requires careful planning to address economic and accessibility barriers, ensuring their effective integration into malaria control programmes. Acceptability The acceptability of spatial emanators is influenced by various factors, including user perceptions, cultural compatibility, ease of use and perceived effectiveness. Findings from community-based studies and deliberations within the GDG suggest that while compliance rates can be high, acceptability remains context-specific, with certain concerns affecting adoption in different settings. Studies assessing user compliance with mosquito coils have demonstrated a generally high level of acceptance. For example, a study conducted in China reported that over 94% of participants consistently used mosquito coils, with more than 90% continuing to use ITNs alongside the coils[100]. Similarly, a study in Indonesia found that 98% of observed mosquito coils were fully burned by morning, suggesting that users did not extinguish them prematurely, reflecting high acceptance of the intervention[101]. These findings indicate that adherence tends to be strong when spatial emanators are perceived as effective and easy to use. However, acceptability is not universal and varies depending on user experiences and contextual factors. In a study conducted assessing passive emanators in Peru[102], a significant proportion of participating households requested the temporary or permanent removal of the intervention for various reasons (e.g. practical concerns such as ongoing construction, and doubts about effectiveness). These findings highlight the importance of individual and community-level preferences in determining the success of spatial emanator programmes. Perceived effectiveness, convenience and potential interference with daily life (including during deployment) appear to all play a role in influencing user acceptance. Cultural and behavioural factors are also critical in shaping the adoption of spatial emanators. For vector control strategies to be widely accepted, they must align with local traditions and practices. By ensuring that interventions do not require significant changes to daily routines, programmes can improve the likelihood of sustained use. From a policy perspective, health care and vector control experts generally recognize spatial emanators as a valuable complementary tool, particularly for providing protection in outdoor settings and during early evening hours when malaria transmission occurs. However, concerns remain regarding the long-term effects of exposure to certain repellent compounds, particularly pyrethroid-based products. Environmental sustainability is another consideration, as widespread adoption of spatial emanators could lead to increased chemical exposure and potential ecological consequences. Addressing these concerns through rigorous safety assessments and environmental impact evaluations will be critical to securing policy support and public trust.

In addition, perceptions of effectiveness varied, with some participants believing that the intervention provided little or no protection against mosquitoes. The portability of emanators is another factor influencing acceptance, particularly among mobile populations who require flexible solutions that can be easily transported and used in different environments. Furthermore,adherence observed in controlled trial settings may not always reflect real-world behaviour, where usage patterns can decline over time due to changing priorities, inconvenience or loss of motivation. In conclusion, spatial emanators are generally well accepted when they are integrated into daily routines and require minimal behaviour change. High acceptance is observed when users perceive a tangible benefit, but concerns remain regarding effectiveness, product replacement needs, health impacts and environmental impacts. To ensure long-term adoption, future research should explore strategies for optimizing cultural adaptation, improving perceived efficacy, and assessing sustained adherence in different communities. Understanding these factors will be essential for maximizing the potential of spatial emanators as a viable malaria prevention tool. 91 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Feasibility The feasibility of large-scale deployment of spatial emanators depends on multiple factors, including duration of efficacy, distribution and deployment logistics, coverage levels, and integration with existing malaria control strategies. Insights from the GDG deliberations and the systematic review highlight key challenges and considerations that must be addressed to ensure feasibility. One of the most significant logistical concerns is the duration of efficacy. Products with shorter durations (e.g. one month) may pose a challenge in terms of supply chain management and operational sustainability, including disposal. The frequent need for replacement increases logistical complexity, particularly in low-resource settings where distribution systems may already be stretched. However, the GDG recognized that new products with longer durations of efficacy are currently under development. Such longer lasting alternatives – ideally with a minimum duration of 12 months – would greatly enhance feasibility by reducing the burden of frequent replacement and ensuring more consistent protection. The distribution and deployment of spatial emanators present both opportunities and challenges. Unlike ITNs and IRS, spatial emanators can be used in a variety of settings, including both urban and rural areas and in humanitarian settings, without being limited by factors such as infrastructure availability and access to electricity. Spatial emanators could provide protection to everyone in the protected area, regardless of the time of day, the number of inhabitants and whether they are sleeping. In addition, some passive emanators can be set up independently by users, reducing reliance on trained personnel, in contrast to IRS, which requires technical expertise for application. In low-resource settings, successful deployment will likely depend on the integration of spatial emanators into national malaria strategies", "page_start": 91, "page_end": 92, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

In addition, some passive emanators can be set up independently by users, reducing reliance on trained personnel, in contrast to IRS, which requires technical expertise for application. In low-resource settings, successful deployment will likely depend on the integration of spatial emanators into national malaria strategies and existing community engagement programmes to ensure effective roll-out and sustained use. Coverage levels and operational considerations probably determine feasibility. Studies reported spatial emanator coverage using different metrics, making it difficult to systematically assess effectiveness. Some trials measured coverage based on the number of households receiving at least one emanator, while others used application rates calculated per square metre. These inconsistencies highlight the need for standardized reporting across studies to allow for better comparison and more realistic evaluation of real-world deployment. Given that spatial emanators function at a community level, coverage should also be measured at this scale, with appropriate targets set to reflect their broader impact. Possible coverage metrics include the proportion of households using spatial emanators according to manufacturer specifications and the proportion of individuals spending time in protected spaces. Another key consideration is the feasibility of mosquito coils, which are already used in some rural areas due to their lower infrastructure requirements. Their relative ease of deployment makes them a practical option in locations where other interventions, such as IRS, are unfeasible or unavailable. However, the need for frequent replacement remains a significant challenge, along with concerns about fire hazards and environmental waste. The long-term sustainability of coils is questionable, particularly in areas where more durable and efficient alternatives may be introduced. Despite the promising aspects of spatial emanators, there remain key research gaps that must be addressed to facilitate large-scale implementation. The overall feasibility of deployment and product replacement at scale is still uncertain, requiring further study to determine the sustainability of supply chains and programmatic distribution models. In addition, community-level feasibility – including long- term adherence, user acceptance and (potentially) willingness to pay (if spatial emanators are not integrated into national programmatic vector control) – needs to be explored to ensure that spatial emanators are both desirable and practical for end-users. Another unresolved question is how pyrethroid- resistant mosquitoes respond to spatial emanators that use the same insecticide class. If resistance reduces effectiveness, this could have significant implications for the long-term viability of this intervention. In conclusion, the feasibility of spatial emanators is influenced by multiple factors, including product longevity, acceptability, affordability and integration into existing malaria control programmes. Longer lasting products would improve feasibility by reducing logistical challenges, while self-deployable options would enhance accessibility.

Careful consideration when integrating spatial emanators into national malaria strategies will be essential for maximizing their potential as a viable vector control tool. 92 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Justification The systematic review on spatial emanators identified notable heterogeneity in the efficacy of the intervention between studies, which was linked to several key factors. These included the community coverage of the intervention achieved in the trials, the density of the product used per covered space, whether it was a high or moderate transmission setting, and whether the intervention was a mosquito coil or a passive emanator. In addition, in one trial, there was heterogeneity in the amount of active ingredient measured on supposedly used products. The inconsistency of outcomes across trials therefore led the GDG to consider only a conditional recommendation for use. The intervention was deemed largely acceptable to end-users and feasible to deploy, although deployment efficiency may be improved by harmonizing routine ITN deployments and community health efforts with deployment of the intervention. Equity was thought to probably increase with the use of spatial emanators, with some evidence that non-users within buffer zones also have increased protection against mosquito bites. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention, in its capacity to reduce disease burden, requires further investigation under different deployment models, with and without background interventions. Addressing the identified research gaps could potentially strengthen the recommendation, or, at minimum, broaden the recommended scope of spatial emanator use. Research needs The following research needs or gaps were identified as valuable for further developing the scope of and/or refining the existing recommendation for the use of spatial emanators: - Quantify the impact of community coverage rates on the protective efficacy of spatial emanators, and determine whether all products require the same threshold coverage to achieve impact. - Evaluate spatial emanators as a stand-alone intervention and in combination with existing vector control interventions to quantify the additive and synergistic effects of different combinations of vector control tools. - Quantify the susceptibility of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes to pyrethroid-based spatial emanators. - Quantify the potential for use and efficacy of spatial emanators outdoors, in peri-domestic settings, in mobile populations, and in structures that are not amenable to IRS application or installation of ITNs. - Quantify the efficacy of spatial emanators in emergency settings (including humanitarian emergencies). - Quantify the protective efficacy of spatial emanators in low versus moderate to high transmission settings. - Understand the protective effect of spatial emanators", "page_start": 92, "page_end": 93, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

In relation to resource requirements and cost-effectiveness, the following areas were identified as useful for informing future deliberations: - Determine the resource requirements associated with different distribution approaches and frequencies in different settings. - Compare the cost-effectiveness of products with different durations of efficacy (e.g. three months vs. 12 months). - Compare the cost-effectiveness of spatial emanators to that of other vector control interventions, with and without background core interventions. - Conduct modelling to determine the impact of heterogeneous coverage on equity of protection. 93 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation against , Very low certainty evidence Space spraying (2019) Space sprayingis not recommended for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission; IRS or ITNs should be prioritized instead. The panel recommended against the deployment of space spraying to control malaria, given the lack of evidence of impact against malaria. Due to the short-lived nature of the insecticides used, space spraying is generally costly and wasteful of resources.

No undesirable effects were identified by systematic review. Certainty of the Very low evidence The systematic review assessed that the overall certainty of the evidence that space spraying has an impact on malaria was very low. Resources and Specialist technical equipment would be required to undertake space spraying. Combined with the other human resource needs and the need for large amounts of insecticide, the costs are anticipated to be considerations high, especially given the low residual effect of the chemicals used. Cost-effectiveness is considered to be limited for this intervention. Justification Only one observational study was identified by the systematic review and the certainty of the evidence was graded as very low[103]. The lack of data from RCTs, other trial designs or quasi-experimental studies has therefore hampered a comprehensive assessment of this intervention and the review concluded that it is unknown whether space spraying causes a reduction in the incidence of malaria. The anticipated desirable effects of space spraying are likely to be small, as the insecticide formulations used are short-lived.Anophelesmosquitoes are generally considered to be less susceptible to space spraying thanCulexorAedes. Space spraying is frequently applied when cases are at their peak, which is followed by a decline in cases, whether or not control measures are applied. Nevertheless, space spraying is often deployed in response to outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease. Due to the high visibility of this intervention, the decision to use this approach is usually made to demonstrate that the authorities are taking action in response to the outbreak. This practice should be strongly discouraged given the limited evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness, the high cost and the potential wastage of resources. The GDG therefore felt it necessary to develop a clear recommendation against space spraying for malaria control. Research needs - Determine the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical]and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/ unintended consequences of space spraying, particularly in emergency situations. 94 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence House screening (2021) Screening of residential houses can be used for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission.

Programmes should note that this recommendation addresses the use of screening of windows, ceilings, doors and/or eave spaces, and does not cover other ways of blocking entry points into houses. Practical info If house screening is being considered as a means to prevent malaria, it is important to identify who the end-user will be and how the intervention will be implemented, i.e. whether screening of houses will be a tool that the programme promotes for individuals or communities to implement at their own cost, or whether it will be undertaken as a programmatic initiative. Depending on the approach, the resources needed, feasibility, uptake and impact on equity may vary and would need to be considered. Screening of houses may be done post-construction or could be a standard feature for new homes. Intersectoral collaboration, for example, between health, housing and environmental sectors, is crucial in the implementation of house screening. It is also important to consider what standards and criteria, if any, need to be set for screening materials and designs, as they are for buildings. Screening of residential houses should be part of an IVM approach as promoted under the GVCR[16]. Deployment of interventions recommended for large-scale deployment (such as ITNs or IRS) should be maintained, and communities should be encouraged to continue using ITNs regularly or allow their houses to be sprayed, even if screening has been installed. In settings where national or local government authorities are not able to provide screening of residential houses as a public health strategy (e.g. due to feasibility/resource challenges), they should promote its use in affected communities. If house screening is deployed or adopted by communities to prevent malaria, post-distribution monitoring of the intervention is needed to assess material durability, usage and coverage. This information should guide how regularly screens require replacement or repair and provide information on the sustainability of the intervention. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review[104]included two cRCTs conducted inEthiopia andGambiathat compared screened houses (withoutinsecticide) to unscreened houses.There was low-certainty evidence that screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused byP. falciparum(rate ratio: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18–0.82; one trial, low-certainty evidence) and parasite prevalence (risk ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.60–1.17; one trial; low-certainty evidence).

Anaemia was also reduced (risk ratio: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.42–0.89; one trial, moderate-certainty evidence).Screening may reduce the EIR, as both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. The systematic review noted from a pooled analysis of the two studies that individuals living in screened houses (covered eaves, windows and doors) were 16% less likely to sleep under a mosquito net (risk ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.65–1.09; two trials, 203 participants).However, the results from the two studies were discrepant: in Ethiopia,thestudy[105]found no difference in ITN use in screened or unscreened homes, while the study[106]in Gambiafound that reported use of ITNs was lower in houses with screened ceilings (26%, 70/272) than in control houses (35%, 57/162; p=0.04). In the Gambian study, the 95 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) number of mosquitoes in the house were reduced, which could have resulted in fewer participants feeling the need to use a net to prevent biting. None of the other pre‐specified outcomes (all‐cause mortality; other disease incidence; adverse effects; unintended effects other than bed net usage) were reported in the included studies. Based on the evidence presented in the review, the GDGjudged that in some settings there may bepotential undesirable effectsassociated with house screening; however, all of the potential effects identified by the GDGwere judged to be small: - Inhabitants of screened houses maystop or reduce their use ofother effective interventions such as ITNs,especially if house screening is perceived to greatly reduce mosquito entry and/or be sufficient alone to protect against malaria. The decline or discontinuation in the use of interventions is likely not limited to those deployed with house screening; if any intervention that is deployed in conjunction with another is perceived to be sufficiently effective alone, use of the co-deployed intervention may decline. - Screeningof available entry points for mosquitoes into the house may result inreduced airflow andventilation,and increased indoor temperatures compared to unscreened openings. While the GDG remarked that, as a result, occupants may open doors and windows (thereby negating the benefit of screening and, in turn, increasing the risk of mosquito exposure), in Côte d’Ivoire this was not the case. Households with screened openings did not differ from those with no screening in terms of opening and closing windows[107].Reduced airflow and ventilation has been shown to result in increased respiratory problems and infections[108]and increased indoor air pollution, which negatively affects human health[109][110][111].

Resources Resources needed for the screening of houses may depend on whether the intervention is deployed by the programme or implemented by the community. The list below, compiled by the GDG, itemizes resources that should be considered. Note that this list does not include resource needs for product selection or assessment of impact of the intervention.

Depending on how the intervention is deployed, the effect on equity may vary. For example, if individuals are encouraged to screen houses themselves, equity may be reduced. If the intervention is deployed at the programme level, it may be increased. The impact on equity may also depend on house structure and conditions, as some features may not allow for screening.

In both studies, participants reported that the intervention reduced the number of indoor mosquitoes and house flies. Most participants in both trials chose to have screening after the duration of the trial. Additionally, participants in the study from the Republic of the Gambiareported a reduction in entry of other animals, such as bats, cockroaches, earwigs, geckos, mice, rats, snakes, and toads. In both trials, participants expressed concern that screening would be damaged by domestic animals and children, or that it would become dirty. In the Ethiopian study, some participants reported that they made further efforts to reduce mosquito entry after screening installation, such as filling in wall openings with mud. Feasibility National programmes considering the adoption of screening of residential houses as a public health strategy should assess: - whether the structure and condition of the residential houses in the community allow for the installation of screening and are accessible; - whether adequate resources are available, particularly if houses require screening to be made bespoke and if there is a need to renovate some houses to enable screening; - the level of community buy-in (acceptability and/or willingness to implement the intervention); - the feasibility of implementation if it is on a large scale, including the impact on resource use and potential changes in cost-effectiveness of the programme, and also taking into account the values, preferences and cultural norms of the main stakeholders; and - how the intervention will be delivered and maintained. 97 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Justification The systematic review[104]identified only two eligible published studies assessingthe impact of housing modifications on malariaepidemiological outcomesconducted inEthiopia and Gambia. Both studies investigated the impact of house screening (screening of windows, ceilings, doors and/or eaves) with untreated materials against malaria. The authors concluded that screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence, parasite prevalence, prevalence of anaemia and EIR. In the trials included in the systematic review, research teams deployed screening at the community level and, as a result, there is currently no evidence as to the benefits and harms of individuals or communities deploying screens themselves. The review identified several studies that were yet to be published on the efficacy of insecticide-treated screening, eave tubes or other forms of housing modifications, but the data were not available at the time for inclusion in the review.

However, in translating this evidence into a recommendation strength, the GDG concluded that the recommendation should be conditional due to the low- to moderate-certainty evidence and based on a number of contextual factors. The panel judged that policy-makers considering house screening should assess the feasibility, acceptability, impact on equity and resources needed for screening houses in their contexts in orderto determine whether such an intervention would be appropriate for their setting. Research needs WHO encourages funding of high-quality research on the impact of interventions under the broad category of “housing modifications” to further inform the development of specific WHO recommendations. Results from four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base on housing modifications for preventing malaria and controlling malaria transmission. Publication of these studies is strongly encouraged. A number of specific evidence gaps and associated requirements were identified: - Further evidence is needed on the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of house screening, as well as other housing modification interventions deployed alone or in combination. - Epidemiological evidence is required on the efficacy against malaria of the same intervention implemented in different settings (where vector species may differ). - Evidence is needed on contextual factors (i.e. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to house screening, as well as other housing modification interventions. - Determine the resource needs, costs and cost-effectiveness of various deployment options for house screening (at the programme, community and individual level). - Develop deployment mechanisms and foster community buy-in for house screening and other housing modification interventions. 4.1.4 Research needs WHO’s guideline development process for new vector control interventions relies on evidence from at least two well-designed and well-conducted studies with epidemiological endpoints for a comprehensive assessment of public health value of a new intervention. As such, WHO encourages the use of appropriate study designs, including the generation of baseline data and assessments at appropriate follow-up times that consider elements such as: - the characteristics of the intervention and its intended deployment; - expected durability/residual efficacy and replacement intervals; and - the epidemiology (e.g. pathogen transmission intensity) of the selected study site.

Chemoprevention uses full therapeutic courses of antimalarial medicines at prescheduled times, irrespective of infection status, to treat existing infections and prevent new infections and thus reduce malaria in people living in endemic areas. Chemoprophylaxis usually involves administration of sub-therapeutic doses of antimalarials to prevent new infections and is primarily used by non-immune people travelling to malaria endemic areas.

Chemoprophylaxis usually involves administration of sub-therapeutic doses of antimalarials to prevent new infections and is primarily used by non-immune people travelling to malaria endemic areas. Chemoprophylaxis is not addressed in detail in the current guidelines beyond the short description in this section. Current WHO recommendations for chemoprevention include the intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp), perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), previously known as intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment in school aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA) for malaria burden and transmission reduction, and mass relapse prevention. Each of these recommendations reflects the biological plausibility that a treatment course of an effective antimalarial will clear any existing, and prevent new, malaria infections. This underlying principle can inform the adaptation of recommendations to maximise impact in different settings. The updated chemoprevention recommendations reflect the paradigm shift, outlined in the introduction, to provide greater flexibility to NMPs to adapt control strategies to suit their settings. Standard processes have been used to develop evidence-based recommendations which are not unduly restrictive. We no longer specify strict age groups, transmission intensity thresholds, numbers of doses or cycles, or specific drugs. The effectiveness of a chemoprevention programme will be influenced by a host of contextual and other factors (e.g. intensity of malaria transmission, extent of seasonal variation in transmission, the age group targeted by the chemoprevention programme, the preventive efficacy of the drugs used, the frequency of dosing, duration of protection of each treatment course, availability of drugs, coverage achieved, adherence to the recommended regimen) and by the mix of interventions being deployed in each setting. NMPs are therefore encouraged to consider local data to determine how best to tailor chemoprevention strategies to local needs and determine which age groups should be prioritized where, for how long, how frequently, and with which drugs. Subnational tailoring is increasingly needed, for example to recognize the variation in duration of the transmission season even within a country, meaning that 3, 4, 5 or more cycles of SMC may be warranted in different subnational areas. To support decision making, each chemoprevention recommendation is accompanied by a summary of available research evidence, an explanation of how this was used to inform the recommendation and practical information regarding key considerations for implementation. Protection for travellers to malaria-endemic areas The primary target for these guidelines is people living in endemic areas and no formal recommendations regarding preventive chemotherapy are currently included for non-immune people travelling to malaria endemic regions. People growing up in endemic countries will increasingly be non-immune as malaria control improves. However, epidemiological changes will be heterogeneous and future guidelines will need to consider the use of chemoprophylaxis among people growing up in areas without malaria (e.g. some urban settings) who then travel within their own country to places where malaria is endemic (e.g. many rural settings).

However, epidemiological changes will be heterogeneous and future guidelines will need to consider the use of chemoprophylaxis among people growing up in areas without malaria (e.g. some urban settings) who then travel within their own country to places where malaria is endemic (e.g. many rural settings). The potential of chemoprophylaxis for people at risk of occupational exposure to malaria (e.g. farmers, miners) also warrants consideration. Readers interested in the use of antimalarial agents to prevent malaria in people travelling from non- endemic settings to areas of malaria transmission are directed to the WHOInternational travel and health guidance[2]. 102 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) In summary, travellers should start chemoprophylaxis before entering an endemic area, to assess tolerability and, for slowly eliminated drugs, to build up therapeutic concentrations. Malaria may be prevented by taking drugs that inhibit liver-stage (pre-erythrocytic) development (causal prophylaxis) or drugs that kill asexual blood stages (suppressive prophylaxis). Causal prophylactics (atovaquone + proguanil) can be stopped soon after leaving an endemic area, whereas suppressive prophylactics must be taken for at least 4 weeks after leaving the area in order to eliminate asexual parasites emerging from the liver weeks after exposure. 4.2.1 Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) is the administration of a treatment course of an antimalarial medicine at predetermined intervals, regardless of whether the pregnant woman is infected with malaria. Malaria infection during pregnancy poses substantial risks not only to the mother, but also to her fetus and the newborn. This updated IPTp recommendation builds on evidence from seven trials that informed the previous recommendation (2012)1for the use of at least three doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for IPTp during antenatal care (ANC) visits in the second and third trimester of the first and second pregnancies to improve birth outcomes. The initial evidence also demonstrated that IPTp reduced maternal anaemia and infection with malaria. This update assessed the potential effects of gravidity, malaria transmission intensity, and SP resistance on the effectiveness of IPTp-SP, and the recommendation has been revised accordingly. 1The evidence showed that, compared to two doses, three or more doses of IPTp-SP increased mean birthweight by 56g (95% CI: 29–83g higher; high-certainty evidence); reduced the number of low birthweight infants (relative risk: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69–0.94; high-certainty evidence); reduced placental parasitaemia (relative risk: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.38–0.68; high-certainty evidence); and probably reduced maternal parasitaemia (relative risk: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.52–0.89; moderate-certainty evidence).

Strong recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (2022) In malaria-endemic areas, pregnant women of all gravidities should be given antimalarial medicine at predetermined intervals to reduce disease burden in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. - Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been widely used for malaria chemoprevention during pregnancy and remains effective in improving key pregnancy outcomes. - IPTp-SP should start as early as possible in the second trimester and not before week 13 of pregnancy. - Doses should be given at least one month apart, with the objective of ensuring that at least three doses are received. - Antenatal care (ANC) contacts remain an important platform for delivering IPTp. Where inequities in ANC service and reach exist, other delivery methods (such as the use of community health workers) may be explored, ensuring that ANC attendance is maintained and underlying inequities in ANC delivery are addressed. - IPTp is generally highly cost-effective, widely accepted, feasible for delivery and justified by a large body of evidence generated over several decades. Practical info Antimalarial medicine WHO recommends that the medicines used for IPTp be different from those used as first-line malaria treatment. SP has been widely used for chemoprevention during pregnancy and has been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive. A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly observed single dose, such as SP, is preferable to a multi-day regimen. The Guideline Development Group did not formally consider alternative drug regimens to SP for IPTp, or their associated costs. However, recent studies of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAP) in areas of high SP resistance have shown that, although superior to SP in reducing malaria during pregnancy, the use of DHAP did not translate into better pregnancy outcomes; SP was associated with better fetal growth, resulting in higher mean birthweights in all gravidae (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(a)). Transmission In areas of moderate to highP. falciparumtransmission, IPTp-SP should be given to all pregnant women. Whether there continues to be a role for IPTp in areas where malaria transmission has fallen to low levels is uncertain. There is evidence that even in areas 103 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) withPfPR2-10< 3%, IPTp-SP reduces maternal anaemia and may reduce low birthweight, as well as maternal and placental infection (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(a)). Some of these effects may not be due to the effects of IPTp-SP on malaria. There is currently insufficient data to define the level of transmission below which IPTp-SP may cease to be cost-effective. Challenges of IPTp reintroduction after withdrawal caution against discontinuing IPTp-SP following a recent reduction in malaria transmission.

There is currently insufficient data to define the level of transmission below which IPTp-SP may cease to be cost-effective. Challenges of IPTp reintroduction after withdrawal caution against discontinuing IPTp-SP following a recent reduction in malaria transmission. Pregnancy IPTp improves a wide range of outcomes in women in their first and second pregnancies, including maternal and placental infection, maternal anaemia and low birthweight (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(a)). There is now evidence that IPTp also reduces maternal infection in third or subsequent pregnancies, but there are currently too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes in these women (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(a)). Administering IPTp to all pregnant women regardless of number of pregnancies facilitates ease of IPTp implementation for health workers. Dosage IPTp-SP should ideally be administered as directly observed therapy (DOT) with three tablets of SP (each tablet containing 500 mg/25 mg SP), for the total required dosage of 1500 mg/75 mg SP. Schedule IPTp-SP should not be given before week 13 of pregnancy due to an increased risk of fetal malformation. IPTp-SP should start in the second trimester and doses should be given at each scheduled ANC contact until the time of delivery, provided that doses are at least one month apart. At least three doses of IPTp-SP should be received during pregnancy. Delivery ANC contacts remain an important platform for delivering IPTp, and so inequities in ANC service and reach should be addressed. Research on alternative approaches to IPTp delivery (e.g. through community health workers) may identify opportunities to increase coverage, while ensuring that ANC attendance is maintained. This may be useful for supporting IPTp delivery while measures to address ANC inequities are implemented. Consideration should be given to contextual factors such as the values and preferences of end-users, costs, coverage and sustainability of alternative delivery platforms. Drug resistance IPTp-SP appears to select for antifolate resistance mutations associated with low to moderate increases in drug resistance. However, there is no convincing evidence of selection favouring key mutations, such asdhpsA581G, which is associated with the loss of IPTp-SP efficacy (Ploweunpublished evidence). There is also insufficient evidence to withhold IPTp-SP in areas where the prevalence ofdhpsA581G exceeds a threshold of 10% (Ploweunpublished evidence). Although the ability of IPTp-SP to clear existing infections and prevent new ones is compromised in areas of high to very high resistance, the intervention still reduces low birthweight and maternal anaemia. Consequently, IPTp-SP should continue to be used in areas of high SP resistance until more effective alternatives for malaria chemoprevention are found. Contraindications IPTp is not recommended for pregnant women before week 13 of pregnancy, or those with severe acute illness, or who are unable to take oral medication, or women who during the last 30 days received a dose of any of the drugs being used for IPTp, or those allergic to any of the components of SP.

IPTp-SP should not be given to individuals receiving a sulfa-based medicine as treatment or prophylaxis, including co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole) for HIV. High doses of folic acid (daily dose ≥ 5 mg) have been shown to counteract the efficacy of SP as an antimalarial, and only low-dose formulations (i.e. 0.4 mg daily) should be co- administered with SP. Other considerations Information about IPTp should be fully accessible to pregnant women. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the pregnant woman prior to administering IPTp. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms In the mother - Anaemia: IPTp-SP may reduce maternal anaemia (risk ratio: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87–0.93; low-certainty evidence) and increase maternal haemoglobin (mean difference: 0.19 g/dL higher; 95% CI: 0.15–0.22 g/dL higher; low-certainty evidence) for each dose of SP in all gravidae. The effect is lower but remains significant in the highest SP resistance areas1(relative risk reduction: 8.2%; 95% CI: 3–13%). IPTp-SP also reduced maternal anaemia in areas withPfPR2-10< 3% (risk ratio: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85–0.97). 104 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - Placental and maternal malaria infection at delivery: IPTp-SP probably reduces placental infection (risk ratio: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.74–0.84; moderate-certainty evidence) and maternal malaria infection at delivery (risk ratio: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.75–0.85; moderate-certainty evidence) for each dose of SP in all gravidae, compared to no IPTp-SP. Overall, IPTp-SP was associated with a 20% reduction (95% CI: 16–24%) in placental or maternal malaria at delivery compared to no IPTp-SP. The effect was greater in first and second pregnancies (24%; 95% CI: 19–29%) than in third or subsequent pregnancies (17%; 95% CI: 13–20%). There was a trend towards reduced efficacy with increased resistance, with a relative risk of 28% (95% CI: 20–36%) in the lowest resistance stratum and 22% (95% CI: 14–29%), 8% (95% CI: 0–7%) and -5% (95% CI: -16–5%) in the moderate, high and very high resistance strata, respectively. The effect of IPTp-SP in areas withPfPR2-10< 3% was variable (risk ratio for maternal malaria: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.53–1.01; and for placental malaria: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.68–1.15). - Adverse events: IPTp-SP had a pooled prevalence of serious adverse events of 3.84% (95% CI: 2.20–5.88%) and a pooled prevalence of adverse events of 14.3% (95% CI: 4.9–27.5%).

It is possible that IPTp-SP results in little to no difference in maternal death (risk ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.49–2.80; low- certainty evidence). None of the studies in the systematic review reported onmalaria infection,severe malaria, ormaternal hospitalization.

The point estimate is slightly higher in first and second pregnancies (26%; 95% CI: 21–31%) than in third or subsequent pregnancies (21%; 95% CI: 16–26%).Compared to no IPTp-SP, each dose of IPTp-SP probably increases mean birthweight for babies born to women of all gravidae (mean difference: 57 g higher; 95% CI: 44–69 g; moderate-certainty evidence). IPTp-SP was associated with a mean increase in birthweight of 67 g (95% CI: 50–85 g) in babies born to women in their first and second pregnancies and 43 g (95% CI: 26–60 g) in third or subsequent pregnancies. The relative risk reduction in low birthweight decreased with increasing SP resistance, remaining significant in high-resistance areas (relative risk reduction: 23%; 95% CI: 16–29%), but becoming non-significant in the highest SP resistance areas (relative risk reduction: 16%; 95% CI: -4–32%). Mean difference in birthweight was 65 g (95% CI: 44–87 g), 66 g (95% CI: 45–88 g) and 46 g (95% CI: 27–66 g) in the lowest, middle and high SP resistance areas, respectively. There was a non-significant mean difference of 11 g (95% CI: -9–32 g) in the highest resistance areas. - Adverse pregnancy outcomes: Each dose of IPTp-SP may reduce preterm delivery compared to no IPTp-SP (risk ratio: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.71–0.81; very low-certainty evidence). However, the evaluation of preterm delivery and number of SP doses is complicated because prematurity inherently reduces the opportunity to receive more SP doses. It is uncertain whether IPTp-SP reduces stillbirths and spontaneous abortions compared to no IPTp-SP (risk ratio: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.59–0.78; very low-certainty evidence).

Certainty of the Moderate evidence The certainty of evidence across the outcomes ranged from very low to moderate, with a number of the outcomes deemed important by the GDG classed as moderate-certainty evidence. The GDG noted sustained impact of IPTp-SP across all transmission and resistance settings. Consequently, the overall certainty of evidence for the outcomes of interest was considered moderate by the GDG. This reflects the large number of observational studies contributing useful information to these updated guidelines, building on the initial more robust data from randomized controlled trials. More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version. Values and Preferences and values of the target population were determined by: preferences - consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in pregnant women was seen as a priority in endemic areas(CS4MEunpublished evidence); - a synthesis of contextual factors from studies of IPTp-SP, although these lacked data on how IPTp- SP was valued (Rodriguezet alunpublished evidence). The GDG vote on values and preferences was equally split between “probably no important uncertainty or variability” and “possibly important uncertainty or variability” in how the outcomes of IPTp are valued across contexts. The vote was repeated and remained split. Those who voted for the latter felt that IPTp may be valued differently depending on the transmission and resistance context. The consensus of the GDG was not to say that values and preferences vary but rather to highlight the two positions. More information can be found in the civil society consultation report(CS4MEunpublished evidence). Resources An individually randomized, placebo-controlled trial in a moderately intense transmission setting in Mozambique found IPTp-SP to be a highly cost-effective intervention[115]. Based on data from 2007, the financial cost of delivering two doses of IPTp-SP through ANC was about US$ 435.79 per 1000 pregnant women. Delivering two doses of IPTp-SP to 1000 pregnant women resulted in a total health system cost saving of US$ 422.74, 43% of which was attributed to reduced hospital admissions. Consequently, the net intervention cost was US$ 13.17 per 1000 pregnant women. IPTp-SP led to substantial household cost savings for women seen in the outpatient department (US$ 33.89 in direct costs; 95% CI: 6.10–77.20; and US$", "page_start": 105, "page_end": 106, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

However, it did not lead to statistically significant household cost savings for women who required admission for malaria (US$ 8.20 in direct costs; 95% CI: -42.80–55.80; and US$ 11.44 in indirect costs; 95% CI: -20.50–42.70). Delivering IPTp-SP to 1000 pregnant women was expected to avert 18.9 (95% CI: 4.4–33.8) neonatal deaths, or 555.2 (95% CI: 129.0–992.0) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). This study determined threshold values of some variables beyond which IPTp-SP was no longer cost-effective. These were when ANC attendance is lower than 37.5%, the protective efficacy of IPTp-SP against maternal infection is lower than 15%, maternal clinical malaria incidence is lower than 0.15 person-year at risk, or the maternal case fatality ratio is lower than 0.15%. Based on the data from Mozambique, the intervention costs of delivering two doses of IPTp-SP were US$ 41.46 per DALY averted versus US$ 7.28 per DALY averted for three doses[115][116]. The cost of one dose of IPTp-SP was reported to be between US$ 0.63 and US$ 0.79[116][117]. The GDG considered that there were negligible costs and savings associated with implementing IPTp-SP and the certainty of the evidence on the resources required was moderate. The GDG determined that IPTp is probably cost-effective compared to no intervention. 106 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report(Rodriguezet alunpublished evidence). Equity Age, marital status, religion, and living in a rural area were found to influence the uptake of IPTp-SP in 13 studies. Women under 20 years old were generally the least likely to receive three doses of IPTp-SP, with those between 25 and 34 most likely to receive IPTp-SP. Socioeconomic considerations including education level, employment status and wealth index affected uptake of IPTp. Higher uptake was associated with being married and higher education, and some studies found a strong association between employment status and IPTp-SP uptake. Many studies reported that women in the “middle” to “richest” wealth index had higher uptake of IPTp-SP compared to those in the “poorest” to “poorer” wealth categories, including receipt of at least three doses of IPTp-SP. Rural residence was inconsistently associated with improved IPTp-SP uptake.

Living more than 5 km from a health facility was also associated with poorer uptake of IPTp-SP. The GDG considered that the health equity of IPTp varies depending on contextual factors, especially those influencing access to ANC services. IPTp programmes that address inequities will likely improve coverage of IPTp and improve pregnancy outcomes. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Rodriguezet alunpublished evidence). Acceptability IPTp has been widely accepted by pregnant women. Greater knowledge about IPTp has been shown to increase acceptance and uptake of the intervention. ANC attendance is a main driver influencing patient acceptance of IPTp-SP. Numerous studies have reported increased uptake of IPTp-SP with early initiation of education and counselling sessions at ANC, specifically during the first trimester, as well as frequent ANC contacts. In general, women who were concerned about the side effects of SP were less likely to take the recommended number of doses of IPTp-SP. The GDG considered IPTp to probably be acceptable to key stakeholders. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report(Rodriguezet alunpublished evidence). Feasibility Limited knowledge and training of staff on the prevention and management of malaria in pregnancy, including indications for IPTp-SP, contribute to poor uptake. Some health care workers expressed concerns over the lack of ongoing training to update their knowledge, although this was country- and site- dependent. Other issues that impaired the delivery of IPTp included stockouts of SP, under-prescribing of SP (< three doses), and inadequate staffing. DOT was generally, but not always, associated with improved uptake of IPTp-SP. Utilization of DOT was variable, with between 5% and 67% of pregnant women reporting taking IPTp-SP under DOT[118][119][120][121]. The GDG considered IPTp implementation to be feasible, given that it is delivered through ANC.

The GDG was supported by a Steering Group, which included representatives from the WHO Departments for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research and Child Health and Development. The systematic review addressed the GDG’s PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) question regarding whether women of all gravidities should be given SP as malaria chemoprevention to reduce disease burden in pregnancy and/or adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. In particular, the systematic review assessed the potential modifying effects of gravidity, malaria transmission intensity, and SP resistance on the effectiveness of IPTp-SP. The main outcomes of interest considered by the GDG in the systematic review were maternal anaemia and low birthweight. Other outcomes of interest included maternal clinical malaria, placental infection, malaria infection, severe malaria, adverse events, hospitalization, and death; and fetal/infant adverse pregnancy outcomes (spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or preterm delivery), malaria infection, anaemia, severe malaria, hospital admissions, and death. Overall, 102 studies and 105 276 participants contributed to the systematic review. This included seven trials comparing IPTp-SP to placebo or passive case detection, 12 trials or cohorts following women who received IPTp-SP, and 83 observational studies. The studies covered all gravidae. All the included studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, with more studies situated in Central and West Africa (59.3%) than in Eastern and Southern Africa (40.7%). Given that IPTp is an intervention that has proven to be effective, for ethical reasons, no new placebo- controlled trials have been conducted since the last update to the IPTp recommendation. This review therefore included a large number of observational studies. Summary of judgements The Evidence-to-Decision framework captures the evidence from the systematic review considered by the GDG. The GDG determined that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favoured IPTp; negligible costs and savings were associated with IPTp implementation delivered through ANC contacts; the certainty of the evidence on required resources was moderate; and IPTp was probably cost-effective, probably acceptable to key stakeholders, and feasible to implement. The GDG concluded that a strong recommendation should be made for IPTp based on its moderate beneficial effects, small undesirable effects, and moderate-certainty evidence.

A manual for subnational tailoring of malaria interventions is under development. Evaluation The safety and impact of IPTp programmes should be routinely monitored. The effect of IPTp may be evaluated using routine data on hospital deliveries, clinic and/or community health worker data. The WHOchemoprevention efficacy study (CPES) protocolshould be used to monitor the efficacy of medicines used for chemoprevention. Although the potential effect of chemoprevention on the spread of drug resistance may be monitored by the analysis of molecular markers associated with treatment outcomes, the correlation between molecular markers and the efficacy of antimalarials for chemoprevention is unclear and results should be interpreted with caution. Given that SP continues to have positive outcomes for mother and baby even in areas of very high SP resistance, national malaria programmes may want to continue IPTp-SP programmes, despite worsening efficacy on malaria-specific outcomes. Research needs Several evidence gaps were identified regarding IPTp. None should prevent adoption and implementation of IPTp. Nevertheless, impact could potentially be enhanced by determining: - the effectiveness of alternative drug regimens for IPTp, including SP + diydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAP); - the non-malarial effect of SP on pregnancy outcomes1; - the effectiveness of alternative approaches to IPTp delivery (e.g. community-based approaches) to improve uptake and address inequities in coverage compared to comparable investment in ANC services. Data on the safety and effectiveness of alternatives to SP for IPTp will be reviewed by WHO when the relevant meta-analyses are available. 108 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 1Despite a near complete loss of its antimalarial effects in areas of very high SP resistance, SP continues to positively impact fetal growth and maternal anaemia. This may be mediated through a non-malarial pathway. This is consistent with the results of an individual patient data meta-analysis, including data from six trials comparing IPTp with DHAP vs IPTp with SP. These data showed that IPTp with DHAP was much more effective than SP in reducing malaria in areas of high SP resistance. However, this did not translate into better pregnancy outcomes, primarily because SP was associated with better fetal growth and thus higher mean birthweights in all gravidae. This may reflect the broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of sulfadoxine, a long-acting sulfonamide, and the associated reduced risk of persistent bacterial infections, and/or its influence on the maternal gut microbiome, and/or its ability to reduce inflammation (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence (a)). 4.2.2 Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) - formerly intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants (IPTi) Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) is the administration of a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine at predefined intervals,", "page_start": 108, "page_end": 109, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The goal of PMC is to protect young children by establishing preventive antimalarial drug concentrations in the blood that clear existing infections and prevent new ones during the age of greatest risk of severe malaria. Previously, this recommendation referred to intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi). Since the initial recommendation, additional data have documented the value of malaria chemoprevention in children aged 12 to 24 months. The name has been changed to PMC because the updated recommendation no longer limits the intervention specifically to infants and reflects the malaria transmission settings in which the intervention should be considered. Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Perennial malaria chemoprevention (2022) In areas of moderate to high perennial malaria transmission, children belonging to age groups at high risk of severe malaria can be given antimalarial medicines at predefined intervals to reduce disease burden. - Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) schedules should be informed by the age pattern of severe malaria admissions, the duration of protection of the selected drug, and the feasibility and affordability of delivering each additional PMC course (see “Practical info”). - Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been widely used for chemoprevention in Africa, including for PMC. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been effective when used for PMC, but evidence is limited on their safety, efficacy, adherence to multi-day regimens, and cost-effectiveness in the context of PMC. - Previously, PMC was recommended in infants (<12 months of age) as intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi). Since the initial recommendation, new data have documented the value of malaria chemoprevention in children aged 12 to 24 months. - The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) platform remains important for delivering PMC. Other methods of delivery can be explored to optimize access to PMC and integration with other health interventions. - Moderate to high perennial malaria transmission settings are defined as areas withP. falciparumparasite prevalence greater than 10% or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 per 1000[30]. These thresholds are indicative and should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of the PMC recommendation.

Practical info Antimalarial medicine WHO recommends that medicines used for PMC be different from those used as first-line malaria treatment. SP has been widely used for chemoprevention in Africa and has been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive. SP was evaluated in 10 trials for PMC, artesunate-amodiaquine (AS+AQ) in one trial, DHAP in one trial, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine + artesunate (SP+AS) in one trial[126]. All regimens were found to be effective in reducing clinical malaria. Although ACTs have been effective when used for PMC, evidence is limited on their safety (including potential cumulative toxicity), efficacy, adherence to multi-day regimens, and cost-effectiveness in the context of PMC in young children. A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly observed single dose, such as SP, is preferable to multi-day regimens. Age group The target age group should be identified using local data on the age distribution of malaria admissions and severe disease. Previously, PMC was recommended in infants (<12 months of age) as IPTi based on evidence generated in this age group and an appreciation of the disease burden they bear. Since the initial recommendation, additional data have documented the value of malaria chemoprevention in children aged 12 to 24 months. Three studies evaluated PMC doses in children aged 12 to 15 109 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) months[127][128][129], and one study evaluated monthly doses in children up to 24 months[130]. Evidence from seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) programmes, where the age of the target population overlaps with that of PMC, also shows that the impact of chemoprevention on disease burden can be sustained beyond infancy with additional doses. However, there is limited information on the safety and efficacy of malaria chemoprevention in children >15 months of age in perennial transmission settings. Dosage Children in age groups at increased risk of severe disease should be given a complete course of antimalarials, at their recommended treatment dose, as PMC. The drug dosage should be determined by the child’s weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the child’s weight is unknown. Frequency The PMC schedule should be informed by the length of protective efficacy of the selected drug, as well as the feasibility of delivering each additional PMC course. SP doses should be given at least one month apart. Eight trials have evaluated a range of 3–6 doses of SP for PMC in the first year of life. Four trials have evaluated 1–12 doses of SP for PMC in the second year of life. The safety and impact of PMC programmes should be routinely monitored.

Research on alternative approaches for PMC delivery beyond the EPI schedules may be warranted. Consideration should be given to contextual factors such as values and preferences of end-users, costs, coverage and sustainability of alternative delivery platforms. Drug resistance The impact of drug resistance on the protection provided by PMC with SP is currently unclear. The duration of protection of SP has been shown to be 42 days in settings without parasite resistance mutations. This was reduced to 21 days in a setting where 89% of parasites carried the quintuple mutation[131]. In settings with aPfdhps540 mutation frequency of up to 50%, 3–4 doses of PMC with SP reduced clinical malaria by 30% over the first year of life[131]. However, in the setting where thePfdhps540 mutation frequency was 89%, no overall protective effect of PMC was observed[131]. The efficacy of SP for treatment is affected by the frequency of mutation-carrying parasites, but there is little evidence that the frequency of molecular markers predicts the efficacy of PMC. Contraindications PMC is not recommended for individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. SMC or MDA). Although PMC and SMC could, in principle, be delivered to different age groups in the same geographical area, for example where there is perennial malaria transmission with seasonal peaks, there is no operational experience of the co-delivery of these strategies. There is currently no experience of co-administration of PMC with the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine. PMC is not recommended in children with severe acute illness or those who are unable to take oral medication, children who during the last 30 days received a dose of any of the drugs being used for PMC, or those allergic to any of the drugs being used for PMC. PMC with SP should not be given to individuals receiving a sulfa-based medication as treatment or prophylaxis, including co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole). Other considerations Information about PMC should be fully accessible to caregivers and key stakeholders, such as government officials and religious leaders. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the caregiver on behalf of the child prior to administration of PMC.

Although available evidence suggests that AS-AQ probably increases the risk of death (risk ratio: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.58–2.55; moderate- certainty evidence), the actual effect varies, and it is possible that there is little or no difference. - Parasitaemia: PMC probably reduces the risk of parasitaemia compared to placebo or no PMC when using SP (rate ratio: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.56–0.79; moderate-certainty evidence). No data were available on this outcome for AS-AQ, SP+AS or DHAP in the meta-analysis. - Adverse events: In one study, the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher in children who received PMC with SP compared to placebo (risk ratio: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.51–3.35)[127]. - Potential drug–vaccine interactions and blood transfusionswere outcomes not covered by the systematic review.

More information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review[126]. Certainty of the Moderate evidence The overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of interest was considered moderate by the GDG. Although the certainty of evidence, summarized under “Benefits and harms”, ranged from low to high, the priority outcomes of clinical malaria and anaemia were assessed as moderate-certainty evidence, while severe malaria was considered low-certainty evidence. More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version. Values and Preferences and values of the target population were determined by: preferences - consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in children under 5 years was seen as a priority in endemic areas (CS4MEunpublished evidence); - a synthesis of contextual factors from trials and pilots of PMC, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, which showed that PMC is generally widely accepted by caregivers (Steinhardtunpublished evidence(a)). The GDG determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in how the outcomes of PMC are valued across contexts. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Steinhardtunpublished evidence(a))and civil society consultation report (CS4MEunpublished evidence). Resources PMC is generally considered cost-effective or highly cost-effective due to its use of the EPI delivery platform to deliver the inexpensive drug SP. The cost per dose delivered in nearly all studies was less 111 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) than $0.25 for PMC with SP, but more expensive with alternative drugs. PMC becomes less cost-effective in settings with a lower malaria burden, as there is less potential to avert disease, and with the use of more expensive medicines. The GDG considered the overall costs of implementing PMC with SP in children to be moderate and judged that PMC is probably cost-effective compared to no intervention. More information on the evidence can be found in the evidence profile associated with this recommendation. Equity Little information on equity of PMC is available. One study found no association between wealth quintile and coverage of PMC[132].

Acceptability PMC has been widely accepted by caregivers, especially when delivered alongside vaccinations using the EPI platform. EPI has also been generally well accepted and perceived as beneficial. Despite some health workers not liking the process of administering PMC and some complaints that it increased workload, most had positive perceptions of PMC, with some suggesting that it improved EPI attendance. The GDG considered that PMC was probably acceptable to key stakeholders. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Steinhardt unpublished evidence(a)). Feasibility Despite logistical challenges such as access to clean water, crushing the tablets, and occasional drug shortages, PMC implementation appears feasible when it is delivered through the EPI platform. One time-and-motion study in the United Republic of Tanzania found that the median time used for PMC implementation was 12.4 minutes (ranging from 1.6 minutes to 28.9 minutes) per nurse per vaccination session[133]. The GDG considered PMC implementation to be feasible. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Steinhardt unpublished evidence(a)). Justification This recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework[122]. Sources of information Recommendation development was informed by a systematic review[126], independently evaluated using the AMSTAR-2 Checklist[134](Steinhardtet alunpublished evidence(b)), and a report summarizing evidence from published studies on contextual factors related to PMC implementation (Steinhardtunpublished evidence(a)), including cost-effectiveness, feasibility, equity, values and acceptability. These sources of information were supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention drug resistance (Ploweunpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4MEunpublished evidence)and contributions from the GDG membership, which included former and current national malaria programme representatives. The systematic review addressed the GDG’s PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) question regarding whether children living in settings with perennial malaria transmission should be given antimalarial medicines as chemoprevention to reduce disease burden. The main outcomes of interest were the impact of PMC on confirmed clinical malaria, severe malaria, and anaemia. Other outcomes of interest included: hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria-specific); all-cause mortality; adverse events; drug–vaccine interactions; parasite prevalence; and blood transfusions. Twelve trials were included in the review, three of which were cluster-randomized controlled trials. All the trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa: Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Uganda, and the United Republic of Tanzania. SP was evaluated in 10 trials, amodiaquine in one trial, AS-AQ in one 112 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) trial, DHAP in one trial, and SP+AS in one trial1.

The systematic review included trials that compared PMC with no intervention in young children (aged eight weeks to 24 months), with length of follow-up ranging from nine to 36 months of age, and most studies delivering 3–4 doses of antimalarial. The AMSTAR-2 Checklist assessment concluded that the systematic review was well conducted and covered most of the outcomes identified by the GDG in the PICO question (Steinhardtet alunpublished evidence (b)). Three outcomes of interest to the GDG were not covered by the systematic review, namely malaria-specific hospital admissions, blood transfusions, and potential drug–vaccine interactions. Summary of judgements The Evidence-to-Decision table captures the evidence from the systematic review considered by the GDG. The GDG determined that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favoured PMC; moderate costs were associated with PMC implementation delivered through EPI; PMC was considered probably cost-effective, but the use of alternative delivery strategies to EPI may affect the cost-effectiveness of PMC, as might the use of more expensive antimalarials; and PMC was probably acceptable to key stakeholders and feasible to implement. The GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation should be made for PMC based on its moderate beneficial effect and moderate certainty of evidence. 1Three trials evaluated more than one drug for PMC. Implementation Please refer to theIntermittent preventive treatment for infants using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTi-SP) for malaria control in Africa: implementation field guide[135]. Evaluation The effect of introducing PMC may be evaluated using routine hospital, clinic and/or community health worker data. The WHOchemoprevention efficacy study (CPES) protocolshould be used to monitor the efficacy of medicines when used for chemoprevention. Although the potential effect of chemoprevention on the spread of drug resistance may be monitored by the analysis of molecular markers associated with treatment outcomes, the correlation between molecular markers and the efficacy of antimalarials for chemoprevention is unclear and results should be interpreted with caution. Research needs Several evidence gaps were identified regarding PMC. None should prevent adoption and implementation of PMC. Nevertheless, impact could potentially be enhanced by determining: - the efficacy of PMC with SP, and alternative PMC regimens, within 28 days of administration; - updated costs and cost-effectiveness of PMC delivered through the EPI, including in settings with low coverage of routine childhood immunization; - the effectiveness of different SP dosing schedules for PMC in children aged eight weeks up to 24 months; - the effect of administering PMC to children >24 months old; - the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of alternative combination drugs for PMC (e.g. sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine [SP+AQ]); - the costs of and coverage achieved by alternative approaches to delivering PMC; - the effectiveness of PMC in different antimalarial", "page_start": 113, "page_end": 113, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The objective of SMC is to establish antimalarial drug concentrations in the blood that clear existing infections and prevent new ones during the period of greatest malaria risk. SMC is recommended in areas of seasonal malaria transmission. 113 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Strong recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (2022) In areas of seasonal malaria transmission, children belonging to age groups at high risk of severe malaria should be given antimalarial medicines during peak malaria transmission seasons to reduce disease burden. - Eligibility for seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is defined by the seasonality of malaria transmission and age groups at risk of severe malaria. Thresholds for assessing these criteria change over time and location. Malaria programmes should assess the suitability of SMC based on the local malaria epidemiology and available funding (see “Practical info”). The added value of a seasonally targeted intervention is likely to be greatest where transmission is intensely seasonal. - Monthly cycles of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP+AQ) have been widely used for SMC in African children under 5 years old and have been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive (Thwinget al unpublished evidence). Practical info Antimalarial medicine WHO recommends a combination medicine for SMC that is different from that used for first-line malaria treatment. The component medicines should have closely matched pharmacology, such that no component is present in the absence of other components for more than a minimal amount of time in order to reduce the risk of new infections encountering only a single drug. SP+AQ has been evaluated in 12 studies of SMC and has been widely used for SMC in Africa. SP+AQ has been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive (Thwinget alunpublished evidence). The prevalence of molecular markers of resistance to SP+AQ was low in the general population before and two years after SMC implementation in seven countries in west and central Africa (Bhattaraiet alunpublished evidence). Safety and efficacy have been evaluated for several other drug combinations, but the lack of widescale implementation means that fewer data are available on the potential risks of cumulative toxicity and impact on drug resistance.

Safety and efficacy have been evaluated for several other drug combinations, but the lack of widescale implementation means that fewer data are available on the potential risks of cumulative toxicity and impact on drug resistance. Age group Most research studies have evaluated SMC in children aged 3–59 months. SMC given to children <5 years old reduced the risk of clinical malaria by almost three quarters (risk ratio: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.25–0.29) during the transmission season (Thwinget al unpublished evidence). SMC has also been shown to reduce the incidence of clinical malaria in children <10 years old. Studies conducted in one country comparing the effect of SMC among children <5 years old with that in children 5–9 years old found no difference in the effect size for malaria incidence or prevalence, severe malaria, or anaemia (Thwinget alunpublished evidence). The age group targeted for SMC should be informed by the local age pattern of severe malaria admissions. The cost-effectiveness of SMC will become less favourable as programmes expand to age groups at lower risk of severe disease and areas of lower malaria transmission[136]. Dosage Children in age groups at increased risk of severe disease should be given a complete course of antimalarials, at their recommended treatment dose, as SMC. The drug dosage should be determined by the child’s weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the child’s weight is unknown. Frequency The number of cycles should be informed by the duration of the high-transmission season, based on the local malaria epidemiology, and the length of preventive efficacy of the selected drug combination. SMC should be used to protect children during the entire high-transmission season. Current evidence supports monthly administration of SMC for 3–4 cycles in shorter transmission settings, and up to six cycles have been evaluated in settings with longer transmission seasons (Thwinget al unpublished evidence). Delivery SMC can be provided through door-to-door or fixed-point delivery. A study in Mali found that door-to-door delivery achieved significantly higher coverage than fixed-point delivery (76.1% versus 62.2%, p = 0.0028)[137]. Further studies in Mali and Gambia have supported that door-to-door delivery can achieve high coverage[138][139]. Studies found similar SMC coverage in children given directly observed treatment compared to non-directly observed treatment[137][138]. 114 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Drug resistance While some prospective trials and ecological studies of SMC with SP+AQ in West Africa have reported increased prevalence of thedhfr/dhpsquadruple and quintuple mutants, other studies have found no evidence of selection.

Contraindications SMC is not recommended for individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. MDA or PMC). Although PMC and SMC could, in principle, be delivered to different age groups in the same geographical area (e.g. where there is perennial malaria transmission with seasonal peaks), there is no operational experience of the co-delivery of these strategies. SMC is not recommended for children with severe acute illness or those who are unable to take oral medication, children who during the last 30 days received a dose of any of the drugs being used for SMC, or children with an allergy to any of the drugs being used for SMC. Children should not be given SMC including SP if they are receiving a sulfa-based medication as treatment or prophylaxis, including co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole). Other considerations Information about SMC should be fully accessible to caregivers and key stakeholders, such as government officials and religious leaders. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the caregiver on behalf of the child prior to administration of SMC. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms - Clinical malaria: SMC probably reduces the incidence of confirmed clinical malaria in children (<5 years old: rate ratio: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.25–0.29; moderate-certainty evidence; 5–15 years: rate ratio: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.25–0.30; low-certainty evidence). The effect size was similar when compared according to the number of cycles (3–6 cycles), transmission setting (moderate vs high intensity), or drug regimen used (SP+AQ, AS-AQ or SP+AS). Studies conducted in one country showed no difference in effect size against clinical malaria incidence between children <5 years and those 5–9 years. However, the absolute impact in older age groups will vary according to the age pattern of disease in different settings. - Parasite prevalence: SMC probably reduces the prevalence of malaria infection at the end of the transmission season in children under 5 years old (risk ratio: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.34–0.43; moderate- certainty evidence) and reduces the prevalence of malaria infection at the end of the transmission season in children <10 years old (risk ratio: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.17–0.44; high-certainty evidence). The effect was similar when compared according to the number of cycles (3–6 cycles), transmission setting (moderate vs high), or drug regimen (SP+AQ, AS-AQ or SP+AS). - Severe malaria: 3–4 cycles of SP+AQ as SMC reduces the incidence of severe malaria in children <5 years old (rate ratio: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.37–0.89; high-certainty evidence) and probably reduces severe malaria incidence in children 5–9 years old (rate ratio: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.23–0.84; moderate- certainty evidence). - Anaemia: SMC probably reduces the prevalence of", "page_start": 115, "page_end": 115, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

SMC reduces the prevalence of any anaemia (haemoglobin <11 mg/ dL) at the end of the transmission season in children 5–9 years old (risk ratio: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52–0.95; high-certainty evidence). - Hospital admissions: SMC probably reduces the incidence of all-cause hospitalization in children <5 years in high-transmission areas (SP+AQ, high-transmission, 3–4 cycles: rate ratio: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.31–0.94; high-certainty evidence; AS-AQ, 5–6 cycles: rate ratio: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.20–0.87; high- certainty evidence; SP+AQ, 3–4 cycles: rate ratio: 1.38; 95% CI: 0.71–2.67; moderate-certainty evidence). - All-cause mortality: There is little evidence of effect of SMC on all-cause mortality in the community (low-certainty evidence). See notes for further information. - Adverse events: SMC increases mild to moderate adverse events in children up to 15 years (risk ratio: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.31–1.51; high-certainty evidence). The most frequent features reported in children receiving SMC (with SP+AQ or SP+AS) were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. - Incidence of infection, blood transfusions, and school attendancewere not reported in any of the eligible studies. 115 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) More information can be found in the systematic review (Thwinget alunpublished evidence). Notes Results from non-randomized studies were consistent with those from randomized studies across all reported outcomes (incidence of confirmed clinical malaria; prevalence of infection at end of transmission season; prevalence of moderate anaemia; incidence of severe malaria; hospitalization; and all-cause mortality, all for children <5 years), except for prevalence of moderate anaemia, where no effect was observed. Adverse events were not reported. There was little evidence of an effect on all-cause mortality. It is plausible that a reduction in severe malaria could translate into an impact on mortality. This was observed in one of the studies that was excluded from the systematic review as it did not use a controlled design[140]. However, the evidence is hard to ascertain due to potential risk of bias from the study designs (trials with clinical malaria as the main outcome are likely to minimize mortality) and systems for reporting deaths in the studies. Implementation of SMC was associated with reductions in malaria deaths in hospitals by 42.4% (95% CI: 5.9–40.9) in Burkina Faso and by 56.6% (95% CI: 28.9–73.5) in Gambia[140].

More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version. Values and Preferences and values of the target population were determined by: preferences - consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in children under 5 years was seen as a priority in endemic areas (CS4MEunpublished evidence); - a synthesis of contextual factors from trials and pilots of SMC (Bhattaraiet alunpublished evidence), but no research was identified that described values and preferences related to SMC. The GDG determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in how the main outcomes of SMC are valued. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Bhattaraiet alunpublished evidence)and the civil society consultation report (CS4MEunpublished evidence). Resources The GDG considered the overall costs of implementing SMC to be moderate. Important cost drivers of SMC are the drug used and the mode of delivery (e.g. door-to-door vs fixed-point). SMC is considered a cost-effective addition to standard care, with the estimated average total economic cost per malaria case averted ranging from US$ 2.91 to US $67.77, depending, in part, on the choice of drug (Bhattaraiet al unpublished evidence). Expanding SMC to children in age groups beyond those at highest risk of severe disease, areas of lower malaria transmission, and the use of more expensive antimalarials will likely influence the cost-effectiveness of SMC. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report for SMC (Bhattaraiet al unpublished evidence). Equity The GDG considered that SMC is likely to enhance equitable service delivery based on similar coverage of the intervention across wealth quintiles in all countries where it is being implemented (Bhattaraiet al unpublished evidence). There was generally no significant difference in SMC coverage by age or gender. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report for SMC (Bhattaraiet al unpublished evidence). 116 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Acceptability SMC acceptability was generally high, with overall refusal rates <1% in five countries (Bhattaraiet al unpublished evidence).

Feasibility SMC delivery approaches and coverage vary across countries. For example, in Mali, SMC coverage was significantly higher in children who received SMC using door-to-door delivery compared to fixed-point delivery (76.1% versus 62.2%, p = 0.0028), while in Gambia, SMC delivery through village health workers achieved a substantially higher coverage level than delivery by reproductive and child health teams (74% versus 48%, a difference of 27%; 95% CI: 16%–38%)[137]. Overall, the GDG considered SMC implementation to be feasible. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report for SMC (Bhattaraiet al unpublished evidence). Justification This recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework[122]. Sources of information WHO commissioned a systematic review to inform this guidance on SMC (Thwinget alunpublished evidence), and a separate report summarizing evidence from published studies on contextual factors related to SMC implementation (Bhattaraiet al unpublished evidence), including cost-effectiveness, feasibility, equity, values and acceptability. These sources of information were supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention drug resistance(Ploweunpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4MEunpublished evidence)and contributions from the GDG membership, which included former and current national malaria programme representatives. The objectives of the systematic review were to assess the effect of SMC with antimalarial drugs on malaria disease burden among children living in places with seasonal malaria transmission, with a specific focus on the age of the children (3–59 months vs 60–120 months of age), the number of treatment cycles during a season (3–4 cycles vs 5–6 cycles), and the drug regimen; and to summarize contextual information regarding acceptability, feasibility, equity, safety, drug resistance, cost and cost-effectiveness. The primary outcome of interest was incidence of confirmed clinical malaria. Other outcomes included: parasite prevalence; incidence of infection; anaemia prevalence; blood transfusions; hospital admissions; severe malaria; all-cause mortality; adverse reactions; and school attendance. Seventeen studies met the criteria for inclusion (12 randomized and five non-randomized studies) and were included in the review. All studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, including in Burkina Faso, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. Twelve studies used SP+AQ, three studies used AS-AQ, one study used SP+AS, and one study used AL. Trials administering three to four cycles were usually located in the sites with shorter transmission seasons, whereas studies administering five to six cycles were in areas with longer transmission seasons.

None of the included studies reported incidence of infection or blood transfusions as outcome measures. One study reported education outcomes but not school attendance. Summary of judgements Evidence from the systematic review (Thwinget alunpublished evidence)and supporting information (Bhattaraiet alunpublished evidence;CS4MEunpublished evidence;Ploweunpublished evidence)was appraised by the GDG in October 2021, a summary of which is provided in the Evidence-to-Decision table. The GDG determined that SMC has a large beneficial effect and that the balance of desirable and undesirable effects favours SMC; the costs of implementing SMC are moderate, although the overall cost would be affected by the drug used and the mode of SMC delivery; SMC is cost-effective, but expanding SMC to age groups beyond those at highest risk of severe disease or areas of lower malaria transmission, and the use of more expensive antimalarials could reduce its cost-effectiveness; SMC is an acceptable intervention; SMC delivery approaches and coverage varied across countries, but were judged to be feasible. In sum, the GDG judged the overall certainty of the evidence as moderate and strongly recommended SMC for age groups at high risk of severe malaria living in areas of seasonal malaria transmission to reduce disease burden.

Second edition[141]. 117 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Evaluation The effect of introducing SMC may be evaluated using routine hospital, clinic and/or community health worker data. The WHOchemoprevention efficacy study (CPES) protocolshould be used to monitor the efficacy of medicines when used for chemoprevention. Although the potential effect of chemoprevention on the spread of drug resistance may be monitored by the analysis of molecular markers associated with treatment outcomes, the correlation between molecular markers and the efficacy of antimalarials for chemoprevention is unclear and results should be interpreted with caution. Research needs The GDG highlighted the following evidence gaps requiring further research. These relate to: - the operational effectiveness of SMC; - the value of administering SMC to children ≥10 years old; - the effectiveness of SMC in areas with seasonal but >6 months of malaria transmission; - the effectiveness of SMC in areas with antimalarial drug resistance; - better understanding of the pharmacokinetics of drugs used for chemoprevention and concentrations required to prevent parasite growth (as opposed to therapeutic concentrations); - the efficacy and effectiveness of delivering SMC with other drug combinations and intervals between cycles. 4.2.4 Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in school-aged children (IPTsc) Intermittent preventive treatment in school-aged children (IPTsc) is the administration of a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine at regular intervals to treat and prevent malaria infections in children who are old enough to", "page_start": 117, "page_end": 118, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in school-aged children (2022) School-aged children living in malaria-endemic settings with moderate to high perennial or seasonal transmission can be given a full therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine at predetermined times as chemoprevention to reduce disease burden. - Intermittent preventive treatment in school-aged children (IPTsc) has been evaluated in children aged 5–15 years. The burden of malaria and benefits of IPTsc may vary across this age range, but evidence is limited. - National malaria programmes can consider IPTsc if resources allow for its introduction among school-aged children without compromising chemoprevention interventions for those carrying the highest burden of severe disease, such as children < 5 years old. - Schools may provide a low-cost means to deliver chemoprevention to school-aged children. However seasonal variation in malaria transmission and the timing of school terms, as well as equity concerns, may mean alternative delivery channels are needed to maximize impact. - First- and second-line malaria treatments should not be used for IPTsc if safe and effective alternatives are available (see “Practical info”). - The dosing schedule for IPTsc should be informed by the local malaria epidemiology and timed to give protection during the period of greatest malaria risk (see “Practical info”). - Moderate to high malaria transmission settings are defined as areas withP. falciparumparasite prevalence greater than 10% or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 per 1000[30]. These thresholds are indicative and should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of the IPTsc recommendation. Practical info Antimalarial medicine Drug regimens evaluated for IPTsc and found to be effective include SP combined with an aminoquinoline (either AQ or piperaquine), SP+AS, and artemisinin-based combination therapy including an aminoquinoline (AS-AQ or DHAP)1. SP+AQ has been widely used for chemoprevention in West Africa and has been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive. In order to reduce the risk of drug resistance to life-saving drugs, first- and second-line malaria treatments should not be used for IPTsc if safe and effective alternatives are available.

As young children (≤ 59 months) are the most vulnerable to severe malaria, chemoprevention interventions to protect this age group should be prioritized over those for school-aged children. If resources allow for introduction of chemoprevention for school-aged children without compromising chemoprevention in younger children, national malaria programmes can consider IPTsc. The majority of IPTsc studies have evaluated the intervention in children under 15 years old. There is some evidence of a stronger effect on malaria-related anaemia in children younger than 10 years versus those who are 10–15 years. However, the effect of IPTsc onP. falciparuminfection was similar across these two age groups. If older age groups are included in IPTsc, particular consideration should be given on how best to include girls with a history of menarche. Certain antimalarials should not be given for chemoprevention without first confirming pregnancy status. There is insufficient information on the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of most antimalarial agents in pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester. In IPTsc studies that have included girls with a history of menarche, pregnancy status has been determined either through self-reporting or the use of pregnancy tests. Further research is needed on how best to safely include girls of reproductive age in IPTsc. Dosage School-aged children should be given a complete course of antimalarials at their recommended treatment dose as IPTsc. The drug dosage should be determined by the child’s weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the child’s weight is unknown or cannot be determined. Frequency The IPTsc schedule should be informed by the local malaria epidemiology, particularly transmission intensity and seasonality, the pharmacokinetics of the drug used, and the feasibility of delivering each additional IPTsc course. IPTsc should be timed to give protection during the period of greatest malaria risk. Most trials provided IPTsc monthly or each term. In settings where PMC is being provided, IPTsc may need to be given at regular intervals throughout the year. In perennial transmission settings, the higher the transmission intensity, the greater the expected value of drugs with longer half-lives or more frequent dosing, which will increase the proportion of time-at-risk protected by IPTsc. If IPTsc cannot be maintained throughout the year in perennial transmission settings due to resource constraints, IPTsc may be timed to provide protection during transmission peaks. Delivery IPTsc can be delivered either through schools or through community-based approaches.

The method of delivery should consider the local epidemiology of malaria and whether school-based delivery will offer protection during the period of greatest malaria risk. All types of schools that cater to children aged up to 15 years in the target area should be included for IPTsc delivery. National malaria programmes may be able to work with existing health programmes targeting school-aged children to facilitate delivery of IPTsc. Children not attending school are likely to be at highest risk of malaria and, if school attendance is not high, special efforts may be needed to target children not attending school. In seasonal transmission areas, delivery in schools may not align with peak malaria transmission and thus it may be more appropriate to utilize existing community-based approaches to reach school-aged children, such as those strategies used for SMC. Care is needed to ensure adequate communication with communities, teachers, caregivers and children to maximize understanding and acceptability in these key stakeholder groups. If older age groups are included in IPTsc administration, communication with key stakeholders should pay attention to the inclusion of girls of reproductive age (see ‘Age group’ above). Drug resistance The impact of drug resistance on the protection provided by IPTsc is currently unclear. A re-analysis of data on resistance markers following monthly IPTsc found no suggestion of an increased prevalence of any resistance markers following DHAP administration2(Ploweunpublished evidence). A review of the relationship between the different chemoprevention strategies (IPTp, PMC, SMC, MDA, IPTsc) and drug resistance concluded that malaria chemoprevention as used to date does not inevitably lead to an increase in resistance, and even high rates of resistance may not necessarily impair chemoprevention efficacy(Ploweunpublished evidence). However, expanded use of antimalarial medicines may increase resistance and eventually undermine efficacy. Using different drugs for chemoprevention and treatment, and combining drugs with counteracting resistance mechanisms may help to preserve efficacy(Ploweunpublished evidence). Contraindications IPTsc is not recommended for individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. SMC or MDA). Children with sickle cell disease should be included in IPTsc unless they already receive regular chemoprevention due to sickle cell disease. Co- delivery of IPTsc alongside other school health programmes should consider drug manufacturers’ guidance regarding whether 119 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) IPTsc can be safely given with other medicines and whether there are any additional contraindications as a result. Additionally, there is a need to consider how to include girls of reproductive age who should not be given certain antimalarials for prophylaxis without first confirming that they are not pregnant (see \"Age group' above for further information).

IPTsc-SP should not be given to individuals receiving a sulfa-based medication as treatment or prophylaxis, including co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole) for HIV. Other considerations Information about IPTsc should be fully accessible to school-aged children, their caregivers and key stakeholders, such as teachers. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the caregiver on behalf of the child prior to administration of IPTsc and, depending on age, from the child themselves. 1Relative risk forP. falciparuminfection: SP plus aminoquinoline (0.35; 95% CI: 0.25–0.44); SP+AS (0.04; 95% CI: 0.01–0.07); artemisinin derivative with aminoquinoline (0.18; 95% CI: 0.11–0.24). 2The original analysis limited resistance outcomes to the prevalence of pure mutant alleles for each locus of interest among all samples that were positive forP. falciparumparasitaemia, irrespective of disease. The re-analysis was conducted to compare the proportion of infections containing any resistant parasites, not just pure mutant alleles, based on the principle that any presence of resistance signals the risk of treatment failure. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms - Clinical malaria: IPTsc may reduce clinical malaria during follow-up (ranging from six to 103 weeks) (adjusted relative risk1: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.36–0.60; low-certainty evidence). - Anaemia: IPTsc may reduce anaemia (adjusted relative risk*: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77–0.92; low-certainty evidence). - Parasite prevalence: IPTsc may reduceP. falciparumparasite prevalence (adjusted relative risk2: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.40–0.53; low-certainty evidence). - Adverse events: Eleven studies reported adverse events. No deaths were attributed to study drugs. Three studies reported more adverse events in the intervention group[142][143][144]. The most common adverse events were dizziness, nausea and vomiting shortly after treatment. One (IPTsc with SP+AQ in 6758 students) of the three studies[142]reported 23 serious adverse events (SAEs) – 19 in the IPTsc arm, of which three were judged to be drug-related. The most common serious adverse events were problems with balance, dizziness, feeling faint, nausea or vomiting. Another study with 794 participants reported no SAEs[143], but adverse events included headache, cough, abdominal pain, coryza, skin rash, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. SP+AQ was associated with more adverse events and more vomiting in the first three days compared to placebo. There were no differences in cumulative adverse events between arms by day 42. Among 404 children who received IPTsc with either SP or SP + piperaquine compared to control[144], no deaths or SAEs were reported.

None of the studies that met the inclusion criteria for the review systematically collected data onschool attendance, severe malaria, hospital admissions(all-cause and malaria-specific), ormortality(all- cause and malaria-specific)2. More information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review[145]. 1Adjusted for age, sex and transmission intensity. 2School achievement was not ranked by the GDG as a critical outcome and therefore was not considered. However, the systematic review found a marginal effect of IPTsc on cognitive function in children 10–15 years (adjusted mean difference in standardized test 120 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) scores: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.01–0.71; p-value for interaction = 0.004), but no significant effect was identified when data were combined across all ages (adjusted relative risk*: 0.12; 95% CI: -0.20–0.43; p = 0.4564). Certainty of the Low evidence The evidence for all the critical outcomes was of low certainty because of serious risk of bias and inconsistency between the studies included in the review. Therefore, the GDG considered the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of interest to be low. More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version. Values and Preferences and values of the target population were determined by: preferences - consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in children was seen as important in endemic areas – although children under 5 years old were mentioned as the particular priority (CS4MEunpublished evidence); - a synthesis of contextual factors from trials and pilots of IPTsc in sub-Saharan Africa, which found very little data on values and preferences (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(b)). In one study, parents considered chemoprevention to be useful and recommended that chemoprevention be expanded to include older children and even adults[146]. The GDG determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in how the outcomes of IPTsc are valued across contexts. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(b)) and the civil society consultation report (CS4MEunpublished evidence). Resources There are relatively few data on the cost of IPTsc. Key cost drivers were human resources (the provision of training to teachers) and the drug used, with intervention costs varying substantially based on the selected regimen. In Mali, the cost of delivering one course of SP+AS was US$ 2.72 per child, which decreased to US$ 1.00", "page_start": 120, "page_end": 121, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

In Mali, the cost of delivering one course of SP+AS was US$ 2.72 per child, which decreased to US$ 1.00 per child for SP+AQ[147]. Modelling of IPTsc costs in Kenya estimated the intervention cost to be US$ 1.88 per child treated per year, with US$ 0.25 per child in set-up costs and US$ 1.63 per child in recurrent costs. The modelled cost-effectiveness of IPTsc in Kenya was US$ 5.36 perP. falciparuminfection averted and US$ 29.84 per case of anaemia averted[148]. The largest drivers of cost-effectiveness were the effectiveness of the intervention and the prevalence of anaemia. The GDG determined that the resources required to implement IPTsc varied, and the certainty of the evidence on the resources required was low. The GDG concluded that IPTsc is probably a cost-effective intervention, and if existing health interventions are being delivered through schools, integrating IPTsc could yield some cost savings. The overall effectiveness of IPTsc is likely to be influenced by the local malaria epidemiology and age burden of disease: if school children are at high risk during the school term, then the cost-effectiveness of IPTsc is likely to increase. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report(Gutmanet al unpublished evidence(b)). Equity There is very limited data on how a school-based platform for delivery of malaria chemoprevention to children would affect equity and health equality. The GDG considered the equity of IPTsc to vary, depending on the proportion of children attending school. As those absent from school are more likely to be from lower socioeconomic groups and female, 121 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) delivering IPTsc solely through schools may affect the equity of the strategy. There is some evidence that the effect of IPTsc on school performance may differ between girls and boys[149]. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report(Gutmanet al unpublished evidence(b)). Acceptability Few studies directly assessed the acceptability of IPTsc. Community sensitization was identified as important for improving the acceptability of IPTsc. In one study, 93% of children reported that they would be willing or very willing to take the tablets for IPTsc each school term[143]. Another study, which evaluated IPTsc among other interventions (iron fortification and anthelmintics), delivered two rounds of IPTsc-SP three months apart. Only one person (0.15%) approached for enrolment refused to participate, and there was high compliance (93.7%) among those who participated, suggesting that treatment was acceptable[150].

In a study that added malaria treatment to an existing school-based MDA programme, 87% of children received IPTsc, suggesting that it might be acceptable to combine the intervention with ongoing health programmes[151]. In another study, staff noted issues with acceptance from parents, particularly when there were side effects from the drugs. Consequently, parents would refuse the second and third days of treatment, and acceptance was lower with subsequent rounds[146]. The GDG considered IPTsc to probably be acceptable to key stakeholders. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report(Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(b)). Feasibility The feasibility of IPTsc is influenced by the choice of drug regimen. One study suggested that using a simpler antimalarial regimen would enhance compliance, as single-dose regimens could be administered as DOT. Additionally, feasibility may be adversely impacted in girls of reproductive age, given the need to confirm that they are not pregnant before giving certain antimalarials as IPTsc[152]. Poor uptake of IPTsc in one study was attributed to poor community perceptions about IPTsc and the requirement for parental informed consent[152]. School-based delivery is likely to be more feasible than community-based delivery of IPTsc, but enrolment rates and absenteeism could pose barriers to reaching children through schools[152]. In some countries, schools already provide nutrition services and are sites of targeted insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution and deworming programmes(Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(b)). The GDG considered IPTsc implementation to probably be feasible. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report(Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(b)). Justification This recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework[127]. Sources of information Recommendation development was informed by a systematic review[150], independently evaluated using the AMSTAR-2 Checklist (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(c))[139], and a report summarizing evidence from published studies on contextual factors related to IPTsc implementation (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(b)), including cost-effectiveness, feasibility, equity, values and acceptability. These sources of information were supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention and drug resistance(Ploweunpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention(CS4MEunpublished evidence)and contributions from the GDG membership, which included former and current national malaria programme representatives. The systematic review addressed the GDG’s PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) question regarding whether school-aged children living in settings with malaria transmission should be given antimalarial medicines as chemoprevention to reduce disease burden. The main outcome of interest was the impact of IPTsc on confirmed clinical malaria. Other outcomes of interest included anaemia, school attendance, parasite prevalence, severe malaria, hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria- specific), adverse events, and mortality (all-cause and malaria-specific).

Thirteen randomized trials were included in the review, 11 of which contributed data to an individual participant data meta-analysis. All the trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa: Côte 122 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Senegal and Uganda. Drug regimens evaluated in the individual studies included DHAP in three trials, SP in three trials, SP+AQ in three trials, SP+AS in two trials, SP with piperaquine in one trial, AL in two trials, AS+AQ in two trials, doxycycline in one trial, primaquine in one trial, mefloquine plus multivitamin in one trial, and proguanil plus chloroquine in one trial. The systematic review grouped the treatment regimens by drug class and pharmacokinetic features: SP alone, SP combined with an aminoquinoline (either AQ or piperaquine), SP+AS, artemisinin-based combination therapy including an aminoquinoline (AS+AQ or DHAP), and AL. Treatment intervals ranged from daily (with subtherapeutic doses of primaquine and doxycycline) to every four months, with the majority of studies providing IPTsc monthly or each term (i.e. 3-4 month intervals). The systematic review included trials that studied IPTsc in children aged 5 to 15 years old, with the follow-up period ranging from six to 103 weeks and most studies delivering 1–12 courses of antimalarial treatment. The authors of the review estimated the proportion of the follow-up period protected by treatment for each of the individual studies, and this ranged from 2% to 100%. The AMSTAR-2 Checklist assessment concluded that the systematic review was of sufficient quality, and the inclusion of one new study identified since the systematic review was published did not substantially change the conclusions (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(c)). Four outcomes of interest to the GDG were not covered by the systematic review, namely school attendance, severe malaria, hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria-specific) and mortality (all-cause and malaria-specific). Summary of judgements The Evidence-to-Decision framework captures the evidence from the systematic review considered by the GDG. The GDG considered the balance between desirable and undesirable effects to probably favour IPTsc; costs associated with IPTsc implementation to vary; and the certainty of the evidence on resources required to be low. In addition, IPTsc was considered probably cost-effective; the equity of IPTsc was judged to vary, depending on the proportion of children attending school; and IPTsc was judged as probably acceptable to key stakeholders and probably feasible to implement.

Evaluation The safety and impact of IPTsc programmes should be routinely monitored. The effect of introducing IPTsc may be evaluated using routine hospital, clinic and/or community health worker data. School surveys provide an opportunity to evaluate outcomes related to school attendance and achievement. The WHOchemoprevention efficacy study (CPES) protocolshould be used to monitor the efficacy of medicines used for chemoprevention. Although the potential effect of chemoprevention on the spread of drug resistance may be monitored by the analysis of molecular markers associated with treatment outcomes, the correlation between molecular markers and the efficacy of antimalarials for chemoprevention is unclear and results should be interpreted with caution. Research needs The GDG highlighted the following evidence gaps requiring further research. These relate to: - the efficacy of alternative (e.g. monthly versus each term) IPTsc drug regimens at different transmission intensities; - the value of IPTsc in children 10 years and under compared to the value in children over 10 years old; - the full economic and financial costs (including the cost of engaging communities, parents, school teachers, etc.) of introduction and deployment of IPTsc; - the cost-effectiveness of combining IPTsc with other school health programmes; - the costs and feasibility of alternative strategies to deliver malaria chemoprevention to school-aged children; - the development of drugs suitable for use as chemoprevention in school-aged children; - the effect of IPTsc on community-level transmission; - the impact of IPTsc on cognition and school performance; - the development of drugs for malaria chemoprevention that can be administered as a single dose; - evaluating approaches to safely include girls of reproductive age in IPTsc, including exploring alternative regimens that are safe through pregnancy. 4.2.5 Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) is the administration of a full antimalarial treatment course at regular intervals to children admitted with severe anaemia. The purpose of PDMC is to prevent new malaria infections in children admitted with severe 123 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) anaemia during the period after hospital discharge when they are at high risk of re-admission or death.

Severe anaemia is defined by WHO’sHaemoglobin concentrations for the diagnosis of anaemia and assessment of severity[153]. The aetiology of severe anaemia is multifactorial and it is often difficult to identify the main cause of any episode of severe anaemia without further laboratory tests, including a complete blood cell count. PDMC should be given even when the cause(s) of severe anaemia in an individual cannot be identified. Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (2022) Children admitted to hospital with severe anaemia living in settings with moderate to high malaria transmission can be given a full therapeutic course of an antimalarial medicine at predetermined times following discharge from hospital to reduce re-admission and death. - Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) should be given to children following admission with severe anaemia[153]that is not due to blood loss following trauma, surgery, malignancy or a bleeding disorder. - PDMC implementation should be tailored to admissions of children with severe anaemia and consider the duration of protection of the selected antimalarial, and the feasibility and affordability of delivering each additional PDMC course (see “Practical info”). - Moderate to high perennial malaria transmission settings are defined as areas with aP. falciparumparasite prevalence greater than 10% or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 per 1000[30]. These thresholds are indicative and should not be regarded as absolute for determining applicability of the PDMC recommendation. Practical info Antimalarial medicine Medicines used for PDMC can be the same as the first-line malaria treatment, but an alternative medicine is preferred. SP, AL and DHAP were used in three trials and all regimens were found to be effective for PDMC (Phiriet alunpublished evidence). Age group Local data on the age distribution of severe anaemia should be referenced when determining the target age group for PDMC. Two studies evaluated PDMC doses in children under 59 months[154][155], and one study evaluated doses in children aged 3 months to 9 years[156]. Dosage Children on PDMC should receive a complete course of antimalarials at the recommended treatment dose. The drug dosage should be determined by the child’s weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the child’s weight is unknown or cannot be determined. Frequency The frequency of PDMC administration should be informed by the length of protective efficacy of the selected drug, the duration of the transmission season, and the feasibility of delivering each additional PDMC treatment. Two of the three trials providing evidence for this recommendation provided three PDMC treatments. One trial administered SP monthly starting seven days post- discharge until the end of the transmission season[156]; another trial administered AL at discharge then twice at four and eight weeks post-discharge[154]; and the third trial administered AL at discharge and then DHAP three times starting 14 days post- discharge and then monthly[155].

Delivery Two delivery approaches for PDMC were evaluated in one effectiveness study: community-based and facility-based delivery strategies. For community-based delivery, caregivers received all courses of PDMC on discharge, whereas for facility-based delivery, the caregiver had to collect the PDMC drugs from a health facility each month. Community-based delivery was preferred by caregivers and associated with increased adherence compared to facility-based strategies (community:70.6% vs. facility: 52.0%, p = 0.006)[157]. Caregivers felt that the instructions on PDMC administration written on the child’s health card were sufficient without reminders via text message or from community health workers (CHWs). There was no statistical evidence that SMS reminders resulted in greater adherence (incidence rate ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.88–1.21; p = 0.68)[158]. Drug resistance The impact of drug resistance on the protection provided by PDMC is currently unclear. A relatively small proportion of the population is eligible for PDMC compared to other malaria chemoprevention interventions such as SMC, PMC or IPTp. Hence, the 124 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) selective pressure exerted by PDMC on the parasite population, and consequent risk of PDMC increasing resistance to antimalarials across the population, is likely to be small. Contraindications Individuals should not receive both PDMC and other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. SMC, PMC or MDA). If other malaria chemoprevention programmes are unable to effectively screen and exclude individuals receiving PDMC, then PDMC should not be administered during periods when SMC, PMC or MDA are being provided. Children with sickle cell disease should be included in PDMC, unless they are already receiving regular chemoprevention due to sickle cell disease. PDMC is not recommended in children who develop severe acute illness following discharge, those who are unable to take oral medication, children who during the last 30 days received a dose of any of the drugs being used for PDMC, or those allergic to any of the drugs being used for PDMC. PDMC-SP should not be given to individuals receiving a sulfa-based medication as treatment or prophylaxis, including co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole) for HIV. Other considerations Information about PDMC should be fully accessible to caregivers. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the caregiver on behalf of the child prior to administration of PDMC.

The intervention period began at the first dose of the first course of PDMC and ended four weeks after the first dose of the last course of PDMC. The post-intervention period began on the day after completion of the intervention period and continued for up to 26 weeks (six months). - Re-admission (all-cause and severe anaemia): PDMC probably reduces all-cause re-admission during the intervention period (risk ratio: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.34–0.52; moderate-certainty evidence). In the post-intervention period, the effect of PDMC varies and may result in little to no difference in all- cause re-admission (hazard ratio: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.83–1.30; moderate-certainty evidence). PDMC probably reduces re-admission for severe anaemia during the intervention period (hazard ratio: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.26–0.56; moderate-certainty evidence) and during the post-intervention period (hazard ratio: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.52–1.05; moderate-certainty evidence). PDMC probably reduces re-admission for severe malaria during the intervention period (hazard ratio: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.22–0.48; moderate- certainty evidence), but may have little effect during the post-intervention period (hazard ratio: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.81–1.39; moderate-certainty evidence). - Death (all-cause): PDMC reduces all-cause mortality during the intervention period (risk ratio: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.08–0.70; high-certainty evidence). The effect in the post-intervention period varies and may result in little or no difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio: 1.61; 95% CI: 0.81–3.19; moderate-certainty evidence). Overall, PDMC probably reduces all-cause mortality (risk ratio: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.47–1.28; moderate-certainty evidence). - Clinical malaria: PDMC probably reduces clinical malaria (hazard ratio: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.58–0.72; moderate-certainty evidence), with most of the benefit accruing during the intervention period (hazard ratio: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.36–0.50; versus 0.96; 95% CI: 0.83–1.11 during the post-intervention period; both moderate-certainty evidence). - Adverse events: The three randomized controlled studies provided moderate-certainty evidence on adverse events associated with using different antimalarials: SP, AL, and DHAP. Minor symptoms recorded for those in the SP arm 30 days after the administration of each treatment were similar to those seen in the placebo arm[156]. DHAP administration was associated with vomiting within 60 minutes after drug intake (12.4%, compared to placebo 3.8%)[155]. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported in the study arm receiving monthly AL[154]. DHAP was associated with an 18.6 ms (95% CI: 15.6–21.8; moderate-certainty evidence) increase of the QTc interval (Fridericia correction) after the third dose of each course. All events of QTc interval prolongation were asymptomatic and none of the children in the DHAP group had QTc interval values of more than 500 ms (Fridericia-corrected).

Certainty of the Moderate evidence The certainty of the evidence across all critical outcomes ranged from moderate to high. Only the evidence on the effect of PDMC on all-cause mortality during the 2–14-week intervention period was of high certainty. The GDG consequently considered the certainty of the evidence overall to be moderate. More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version. Values and Preferences and values of the target population were determined by: preferences - consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in children under 5 years was seen as a priority in endemic areas, although there was no specific mention of the need during the post-discharge period (CS4MEunpublished evidence); - a synthesis of contextual factors from trials of PDMC in sub-Saharan Africa (Langeet alunpublished evidence). The report showed that caregivers had generally positive views of PDMC. Caregivers understood the value of giving preventive malaria medicines during the post-discharge period, given that their children had recently been in hospital[159]. CHWs also viewed PDMC as an important and beneficial intervention[157]. The GDG determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in how the outcomes of PDMC are valued across contexts. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Langeet alunpublished evidence) and the civil society consultation report (CS4MEunpublished evidence). Resources The mean estimated cost of implementing community-based PDMC was between US$ 22.91 and US$ 28.33 per child treated in the three countries where the studies were conducted. Implementation costs for community-based PDMC were outweighed by cost savings for re-admission compared to standard care, with a mean expected saving per child between US$ 22.08 and US$ 45.24. Health care providers’ net cost saving per child receiving PDMC, including health care (especially blood transfusion) and societal costs, was between US$ 19.12 and US$ 25.71. Two approaches for delivering PDMC were evaluated: (i) facility-based, in which children had to be brought to a health facility to receive subsequent doses of PDMC, and (ii) community-based, in which the caregiver received all doses for PDMC on discharge with instructions and dates for administration written on the child’s health card, and with CHWs reminding caregivers when to administer doses, SMS reminders, or no reminders.

Community-delivered PDMC was found to be more cost-saving compared to health facility-based delivery due to costs from repeated travel for drug collection, which also posed a disincentive to adherence. The GDG judged that PDMC probably results in moderate savings and is therefore probably cost- effective, but the certainty of the evidence regarding the resources required was low. More information on the evidence can be found in the report on PDMC cost-effectiveness (Kϋhlet al unpublished evidence). Equity None of the studies included in the PDMC contextual factors report were designed to capture issues related to equity. However, caregivers whose children received PDMC from the health facility reported that repeated travel to the hospital to collect medicines was costly and time-consuming. Caregiver literacy was identified as a potential challenge for equitable PDMC delivery among participants who received all medicines when their child was discharged (community-based delivery), as some caregivers may not be 126 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) able to read the PDMC administration dates recorded on their child’s health card. SMS reminders (see “Feasibility” below) may also raise concerns over equity. The GDG considered that PDMC has a variable effect on health equity and noted that PDMC likely reinforces existing health inequities, given that it is administered to children who have already accessed a hospital. Nevertheless, among those who have already accessed a hospital, the intervention is likely to be equitable; however, this may be dependent on how PDMC is administered, with community-based delivery being potentially more equitable than facility-based delivery. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Langeet al unpublished evidence). Acceptability One study showed that community-based PDMC resulted in higher self-reported adherence than facility- based PDMC (71% vs 52% adherence to the full three courses). Community-based adherence may have been influenced by the anticipation of study staff visits for pill counts after each treatment course. Potential stigma from repeated CHW visits may be a potential issue for community-based adherence. The GDG considered PDMC to probably be acceptable to key stakeholders. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Langeet al unpublished evidence). Feasibility For community-based delivery of PDMC, CHWs reported a high level of intrinsic motivation to conduct home visits to remind caregivers to administer PDMC doses.

Positive factors that encouraged CHWs to conduct home visits were the knowledge and perception of PDMC effectiveness, and recognition from the community and the health system.

Nevertheless, adherence to the required number of home visits was poor, with less than half of the CHWs conducting the required home visit reminders. Positive factors that encouraged CHWs to conduct home visits were the knowledge and perception of PDMC effectiveness, and recognition from the community and the health system. Reported barriers to CHWs conducting home visits included poor training, lack of supervision, and high workload. Written reminders of PDMC treatment dates on children’s health cards were positively viewed by participants. Most caregivers preferred SMS reminders over CHW visits, but those who didn’t own a phone had to receive reminders through neighbours and/or family members, which caused delays. Although PDMC adherence was higher among SMS recipients (66.2%) compared to non-SMS participants (56.9%), there was no statistical evidence that SMS reminders resulted in greater adherence (incidence rate ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.88–1.21; p = 0.68). The GDG concluded that it was unclear whether PDMC implementation was broadly feasible, given that there is currently only evidence from three trials, including one implementation study. The optimal approach to PDMC implementation may vary in different places and, where CHWs are involved, may benefit from a direct link between health facilities and community-based care. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Langeet al unpublished evidence). Justification This recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework[122]. Sources of information Recommendation development was informed by a systematic review (Phiriet alunpublished evidence), independently evaluated using the AMSTAR-2 Checklist[134](Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(d)), and a report summarizing evidence from published studies on contextual factors related to PDMC implementation (Langeet alunpublished evidence), including feasibility, equity, values and acceptability, as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis (Kϋhlet alunpublished evidence). These sources of information were supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention and drug resistance (Ploweunpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4MEunpublished evidence)and contributions from the GDG membership, which included former and current national malaria programme representatives. The systematic review addressed the GDG’s PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) question regarding whether children hospitalized with severe anaemia in malaria-endemic settings should be given antimalarial medicines as chemoprevention 127 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) post-discharge. The main outcomes of interest were the impact of PDMC on re-admission (all-cause and severe anaemia), mortality (all-cause), severe anaemia, and blood transfusion. Other outcomes of interest included confirmed clinical malaria, severe malaria, anaemia, adverse events, and parasite prevalence. Three randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials were included in the review. All the trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa: Gambia, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda.

One trial evaluated monthly SP until the end of the malaria transmission season; another trial evaluated monthly AL at four and eight weeks post-discharge; and the third trial evaluated monthly DHAP at 14, 42 and 70 days post-discharge. The systematic review included trials that compared PDMC with no intervention in children aged < 9 years with anaemia, defined as haemoglobin < 7 g/dL (one trial), or severe anaemia, defined as haemoglobin < 5 g/dL. The intervention period started from the first dose of the first course of PDMC and continued until four weeks after the first dose of the last course of PDMC, a follow-up period of 2–14 weeks. The post- intervention period started the day after the completion of the intervention period and continued up to 26 weeks. The AMSTAR-2 Checklist assessment concluded that the systematic review was good quality overall (Gutmanet alunpublished evidence(d)). Five outcomes of interest were not covered by the systematic review, namely severe malaria, anaemia, severe anaemia, blood transfusion and parasite prevalence. Summary of judgements The Evidence-to-Decision framework captures the evidence from the systematic review considered by the GDG. The GDG determined that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favoured PDMC; moderate cost savings were probably associated with PDMC implementation; PDMC is therefore probably cost-effective, although the certainty of evidence regarding required resources was low; and PDMC is probably acceptable to key stakeholders, but the feasibility of implementing PDMC at scale is not known. The GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation should be made for PDMC based on the moderate- to high-certainty evidence of large beneficial effects and likely low costs. Implementation A guide to support implementation of PDMC will be developed in due course, and a manual for subnational tailoring of malaria interventions is under development. Evaluation PDMC programmes should be routinely monitored for safety, efficacy, drug resistance and effectiveness. The impact of introducing PDMC may be evaluated using routine hospital, clinic and/or CHW data. The potential effect of PDMC on the spread of drug resistance is likely to be modest, given the small proportion of the population receiving the intervention. Resistance may be monitored by the analysis of molecular markers associated with treatment outcomes, although the correlation between molecular markers and the efficacy of antimalarials for chemoprevention is unclear and should be interpreted with caution. Further guidance will be made available in the PDMC implementation guide, which will be developed in due course. Research needs The GDG identified the following evidence gaps as requiring further research.

Consequently, any existing infections are treated and new infections are prevented for the duration of the drug’s prophylactic period. MDA has been an important component of malaria control and elimination programmes for decades[160]. Some earlier WHO documents referred to “age-targeted MDA”: however, such use cases are no longer considered MDA and recommendations for such targeted use are presented separately – see recommendations for perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) (section 4.2.2) and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) (section 4.2.3). The use of chemoprevention in occupationally vulnerable groups, such as forest workers, is considered targeted drug administration (TDA) and not MDA. Similarly, use of chemoprevention around a confirmed case in areas approaching elimination or post-elimination preventing re- establishment is known as reactive drug administration (RDA). Although not called MDA, all of these strategies share a common underlying principle – that the provision of a treatment dose of antimalarial medicine will cure existing infections and prevent new ones. Historically, MDA has been given either to reduce malaria disease burden or to reduce", "page_start": 128, "page_end": 129, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Although not called MDA, all of these strategies share a common underlying principle – that the provision of a treatment dose of antimalarial medicine will cure existing infections and prevent new ones. Historically, MDA has been given either to reduce malaria disease burden or to reduce malaria transmission. The distinction between the two MDA use cases forP. falciparumis to some extent artificial, as any intervention that reduces transmission will also reduce disease burden, and burden-reducing interventions that reach a sufficient proportion of the population will also reduce transmission. Nevertheless, the evidence on the use of MDA for disease burden and transmission reduction was considered separately by two Guideline Development Groups (GDGs). The two GDGs broadly recommended that programmes may consider MDA to reduceP. falciparumtransmission in very low to low transmission settings, and to reduce disease burden in moderate to high transmission settings. AP. falciparumprevalence (PfPR2-10) of around 10% (or incidence of infection around 250 per 1000 population per year) may be used to differentiate areas of low to very low transmission from areas of moderate to high transmission. These thresholds should not be considered absolute cut-offs and it is biologically plausible that MDA in settings near the 10% threshold may reduce both disease burden and transmission intensity. However, the relative effects of burden reduction versus transmission reduction differ along the transmission spectrum. Malaria programmes should therefore review the MDA recommendations and practical information for both burden and transmission reduction and decide whether or not an MDA intervention is likely to lead to a successful outcome in their setting. The use of MDA forP. vivaxis more complicated, asP. vivaxinfections may relapse within a few months unless treated with an antimalarial medicine that includes an 8-aminoquinoline to clear hypnozoites. An 8-aminoquinoline medicine has the potential to cause severe haemolysis in persons deficient for the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme. Safe administration of an 8-aminoquinoline requires G6PD testing, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. The two GDGs that reviewed evidence for the impact of MDA onP. vivaxprioritized different outcome measures and arrived at different recommendations. Whereas the evidence was considered insufficient to recommend MDA for the reduction of P. vivaxdisease, it was recognized that, in some situations, MDA may usefully contribute to the reduction ofP. vivaxtransmission. Malaria programmes should, therefore, review the MDA recommendations forP. vivaxand decide whether or not an MDA intervention is likely to lead to a successful outcome in their setting. A chemoprevention strategy related to MDA that is intended to reduce transmission ofP. vivaxis mass relapse prevention (MRP).

In the case of MRP, however, only an 8-aminoquinoline drug is provided. In the past, the strategy used primaquine and was referred to as “mass primaquine prophylactic treatment”. However, the name of this strategy has since been expanded to include the potential for new drugs with similar anti-relapse properties. Generally deployed in areas with cold winters and highly seasonal transmission ofP. vivax, the medicine is provided to the population in early spring, when there is no or very low transmission of the parasite, to treat hypnozoites and prevent relapses that could infect a new population of mosquitoes in the summer months. WHO recommends that malaria programmes tailor intervention packages to their local context. The MDA recommendations are subject to considerations, identified by the GDGs, which will influence the likelihood of successful outcomes. These contextual considerations are outlined in remarks under the recommendations and in the “Practical info” sections. - Recommendations regarding the use of MDA for burden reduction are presented in section4.2.6.1 MDA for burden reduction; and recommendations for burden reduction in emergency settings are presented in section4.2.6.2 MDA for burden reduction in emergency settings; - Recommendations for transmission reduction are found in section 4.2.6.3 MDA to reduce transmission ofP. falciparumin very low to low transmission settings; section4.2.6.4 MDA to reduce transmission ofP. falciparumin moderate to high transmission settings; and section4.2.6.5 MDA to reduce transmission ofP. vivax. - The recommendation for MRP is found in section4.2.6.6 MRP to reduce transmission ofP. vivax. 4.2.6.1 MDA for burden reduction 129 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence MDA for burden reduction (2022) Antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention through mass drug administration (MDA) in areas of moderate to high transmission ofP. falciparumto provide short-term reductions in disease burden. - MDA may quickly reduce clinical malaria incidence in settings with moderate to highP. falciparumtransmission, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria control programme (including good coverage of effective case management and appropriate prevention tools and strategies). - Malaria programmes should judge the suitability of using MDA in their context based on the desired impact, level of endemicity, and resources required. MDA for burden reduction should be targeted at moderate to high transmission settings, regardless of seasonality (see “Practical info”). - Moderate to high malaria transmission settings are defined as areas withP. falciparumparasite prevalence greater than 10%, or incidence greater than 250P. falciparumcases per 1000 population per year[30].

These thresholds should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of MDA implementation. It is biologically plausible that MDA in intermediate transmission settings may reduce both disease burden and transmission intensity. Practical info Transmission setting The impact of MDA on disease burden varies between high and low malaria transmission settings. In high transmission settings, the impact of MDA on disease is likely to be large and may be cost-effective due to the high background disease burden. However, as transmission intensity and the corresponding disease burden decrease, the impact of MDA also decreases and MDA becomes less cost-effective for disease burden reduction. The effect on other outcomes, parasite incidence and prevalence, and incidence of severe disease also appears to vary by transmission intensity. There are no studies directly comparing the impact of MDA for burden reduction with the impact of more targeted approaches to chemoprevention (e.g. SMC) (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a)). MDA for burden reduction should be targeted at moderate to high transmission settings, regardless of seasonality. Antimalarial medicine WHO recommends the use of a combination medicine for MDA that is different from that used as first-line malaria treatment. The component medicines should have closely matched pharmacology, such that no component is present in the absence of other components for more than a minimal amount of time in order to reduce the risk of new infections encountering only a single drug. A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly observed single dose is preferable to a multi-day regimen. Data were insufficient to discern a specific effect of single-dose primaquine. Available evidence suggests that maximum benefits are seen within 1–3 months after the last round of the intervention (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a)). Dosage A complete therapeutic course of antimalarials, at doses recommended by the manufacturer, should be given to all eligible adults and children within a defined geographical area. Drug dosage should be determined by weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the person’s weight is unknown. Frequency The frequency of MDA rounds should take into account the local malaria epidemiology, the half-life of the antimalarial used, and the feasibility and cost of delivering each additional round. Consistent with trial data, mathematical models predict that a single round of MDA would lead to an initial decrease in infections, but that the duration of effect would be short-lived. Application of additional rounds is predicted to substantially improve the impact and duration of effect. MDA should not be given to individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. SMC, PMC, or IPTp) (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a)).

However, where data were collected, MDA had little to no effect on drug resistance markers (PfKelch13andPfplasmepsin2/3 copy number) amongP. falciparuminfections (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a);Ploweunpublished evidence). 130 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Contraindications Depending on the medicine chosen, certain population groups may need to be excluded from MDA. These include pregnant women in their first trimester; infants <6 months of age or weighing <5kg; people recently treated with the same medicine; people with a known allergy to the medicine; anyone with severe acute illness or who is unable to take oral medication; people taking medicine known to interact with the medicine used for MDA; and people with specific contraindications to the medicine used[161]. Other considerations Information about MDA should be fully accessible to caregivers, health workers and key stakeholders, such as government officials and religious leaders. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained, including from the carers of children, prior to administration of MDA. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Moderate to high transmission areas - Clinical malaria: MDA may reduce clinical malaria incidence 1–3 months post-MDA1(rate ratio: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.04–4.42; low-certainty evidence).

Most studies reported on outcomes after the last round of MDA, rather than 132 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) during the intervention period. Studies with multiple rounds of MDA may not have captured important effects that occurred between the first and last rounds of MDA, and outcomes may reflect a cumulative effect for MDA. There is a lack of evidence on clinical outcomes during the 0–1 months post-intervention, when impact may be expected to be the greatest. There is no information on effectiveness if rounds of MDA continue for >1 year. More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version. Values and Preferences and values of the target population were determined by: preferences - consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease is broadly considered a priority, especially in children under 5 years and women in pregnancy; - synthesis of contextual factors from trials and pilots of MDA. One study that surveyed participants’ values found that the most common explanation for the uptake of MDA was the desire to protect their family or community from future malaria infections. The GDG determined that there was possibly important uncertainty or variability in how the main outcomes are valued across contexts, dependent on the transmission setting and burden of disease. More information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a))and the civil society consultation report (CS4MEunpublished evidence). Resources The estimated costs per person per round varied from approximately US$ 1.04 to US$ 19.40; one study estimated that drugs accounted for 70% of the cost of MDA (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a)).The costs associated with MDA are likely to vary depending on the extent to which the intervention could leverage existing campaigns and platforms. Moderate to high transmission areas Data on the cost-effectiveness of MDA are sparse. However, the GDG judged that MDA is likely to be cost-effective in moderate to high transmission settings due to the greater number of cases averted in these settings. Very low to low transmission areas Given that fewer malaria cases will be averted, the GDG judged MDA as probably not cost-effective for disease burden reduction in low transmission settings.

More information can be found in the systematic review (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a)). Equity There was no evidence of a direct impact of MDA on health equity, although the GDG judged that it would likely increase health equity by enhancing access to medicines for those at risk of malaria. Specific effort may be needed to reach high-risk communities, among whom uptake tends to be lower, and ethnic minority communities that may suffer geographical isolation. More information can be found in the systematic review (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a)). Acceptability MDA is probably acceptable to key stakeholders. Studies have shown that sensitization, education, and inclusion of local leaders, such as government figures, religious leaders and health authorities, are very important in improving acceptability. The most common barrier to acceptability is fear of perceived adverse events. Two studies found that participants were concerned that adverse events may inhibit their economic productivity, although, in another study, respondents felt that malaria infection was more likely to limit their economic activity than adverse events. Previous experience reinforced initial perceptions of MDA: individuals who had been part of previous MDA trials shared stories in their communities; if those experiences were poor, community members 133 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) had negative impressions of MDA. In areas where other malaria interventions had been implemented effectively, MDA for malaria was viewed more positively. More information can be found in the systematic review (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a)). Feasibility The feasibility of implementing MDA varies and is highly context-specific, with more remote or mobile populations being harder to reach. More information can be found in the systematic review (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a)). Justification This recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework[122]. Sources of information A systematic review of existing evidence was commissioned to inform this guidance on the use of MDA to reduce the burden of malaria disease (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a)). The review team produced a separate report to address the needs of the GDG developing the MDA recommendation for transmission reduction. The main objective of the review was to synthesize evidence on the efficacy and safety of giving a full therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine at approximately the same time to people residing in defined geographical areas with ongoing human malaria transmission to reduce the burden of clinical disease fromP. falciparumandP. vivax. Secondary objectives included summarizing evidence on contextual factors that affect the implementation of MDA and findings from mathematical modelling studies with respect to the impact of different operational factors on MDA efficacy. The primary outcome of interest was confirmed clinical malaria at 0–1 months, 1–3 months, 4–12 months, and 12–24 months post-MDA. Secondary outcomes of interest included: hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria-specific); all-cause mortality;", "page_start": 133, "page_end": 134, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Secondary outcomes of interest included: hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria-specific); all-cause mortality; parasite prevalence; adverse events; anaemia; drug resistance; severe malaria; and blood transfusions. The systematic review was supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention drug resistance (Ploweunpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4MEunpublished evidence)and contributions from the GDG membership, which included national malaria programme representatives. The systematic review identified 20 studies: eight provided data onP. falciparum(five cluster-randomized controlled studies and three non-randomized studies); five cluster-randomized controlled trials provided data on bothP. falciparumandP. vivax; and an additional seven studies provided data onP. vivaxonly (all non-randomized, before-after studies) (Schneideret al unpublished evidence(a)). The drugs used for MDA in studies evaluating an effect onP. falciparumincluded: amodiaquine (1); AS-AQ (1); chloroquine (1); DHAP (8); pyronaridine-artesunate (1); sufalene-pyrimethamine (1); and SP+AS (2). The drugs used for MDA in studies evaluating an effect onP. vivaxincluded: atebrin (1); chloroquine (2); chloroquine plus pyrimethamine (1); DHAP (5); and pyrimethamine (3). Seven of the 13 studies evaluating an effect onP. falciparumincluded an 8-aminoquinoline, such as low-dose primaquine, as did seven of the 12 studies evaluating an effect onP. vivax.P. falciparum gametocytes andP. vivaxhypnozoites are eliminated by 8-aminoquinolines, but these drugs may cause haemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency. None of theP. vivaxstudies included anti-relapse treatment. Follow-up ranged from 0 to 24 months post-MDA for studies investigatingP. falciparumand studies looking at bothP. falciparumandP. vivax, whereas forP. vivax studies, follow-up ranged from 0 to 12 months post-MDA. Studies that reported data onP. falciparumwere stratified into areas of moderate to high (>10% prevalence ofP. falciparuminfection) versus low to very low (≤10% prevalence ofP. falciparum infection) transmission due to heterogeneity in the outcomes. Three studies were not included in the review due to an imbalance of background interventions. In addition, large-scale operational experience of MDA in Central Asia, China and Russian Federation, among others, was not captured, although MDA has been a prominent feature of control and elimination efforts in those settings. Summary of judgements Evidence from the systematic review (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(a))and supporting information (CS4ME unpublished evidence; Ploweunpublished evidence)was appraised by the GDG in October 2021. The evidence and their judgements are captured in the Evidence-to-Decision table. Where the GDG felt there were differences in moderate to high versus very low to low transmission areas, a separate assessment was made for each transmission setting. The GDG determined that the balance of effects favoured MDA for short-term disease burden reduction in moderate to highP. falciparum transmission settings, given the moderate-certainty evidence that MDA reduces the incidence ofP. falciparuminfection 1–3 months post-MDA and has a consistent-sized effect on clinical outcomes.

The GDG also considered it plausible that a reduction in the incidence of infection would translate into an impact on disease. The balance of effects with regard to burden reduction thus favoured implementation of MDA in moderate to high transmissionP. falciparumsettings for short-term reduction of disease burden. There was insufficient evidence from field trials on the impact of MDA as a long-term (e.g. >1 134 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) year) intervention on disease burden in moderate to high transmission areas. In very low to lowP. falciparumtransmission settings, the GDG favoured standard care over MDA for malaria disease burden reduction, given the low certainty of evidence of desirable effects and the low disease burden in lowP. falciparumtransmission settings: burden reduction alone was not considered adequate justification for implementing MDA in such settings due to the small gains in burden reduction from MDA. The overall balance of effects for MDA for burden reduction inP. vivaxtransmission settings was not considered by the GDG, given the weak and conflicting available evidence. The GDG considered that implementation of MDA was associated with moderate costs and that MDA was considered cost-effective to reduce disease burden in moderate to high transmission settings; however, it was not considered cost-effective for burden reduction in very low to low transmission settings due to the fewer cases averted in these contexts. MDA was probably acceptable to key stakeholders, and the feasibility of MDA implementation was deemed variable, as this is highly context-specific. Studies evaluating MDA have generally explored the potential of MDA to reduce transmission. Such studies prioritize infection end-points and this may limit their ability to detect clinical outcomes. The certainty of evidence on clinical outcomes was considered low, and confidence intervals crossed the null. However, the GDG considered it biologically plausible that a reduction in the incidence of infection would translate into impact on disease, and recognized that the point estimates of effect sizes against these end-points were consistent with each other. The GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation should be made for MDA for short-term burden reduction in moderate to high transmission settings, given the large impact on burden reduction, low risk of adverse events, moderate costs, likelihood of increasing equity in terms of access to health interventions, and likely acceptability of short-term MDA in most settings.

Malaria programmes are also encouraged to evaluate the operational effectiveness and costs of implementation of MDA within their contexts. Research needs Evidence gaps requiring further research include: - the comparative value of age-targeted chemoprevention (e.g. SMC) vs MDA in terms of disease burden reduction; - the relative cost-effectiveness of MDA vs targeted chemoprevention (e.g. SMC) for burden reduction; - the effectiveness of MDA based on different dosing schedules and duration; - MDA drug choice options for young infants; - MDA drug choice options for women in their first trimester of pregnancy. 4.2.6.2 MDA for burden reduction in emergency settings 135 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence MDA for burden reduction in emergency settings (2022) During emergencies or periods of health service disruption, antimalarial medicine can be used for mass drug administration (MDA) in defined geographical areas to provide short-term reductions in the burden of disease caused byP. falciparum. - MDA may quickly reduce clinical malaria incidence in settings with moderate to highP. falciparumtransmission, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. As far as possible, MDA should be implemented as part of a package of malaria control measures (including effective case management and appropriate prevention tools and strategies). - Malaria programmes should judge the suitability of using MDA in their context based on the desired impact, level of endemicity, and resources required (see “Practical info”). - There is very limited evidence on the impact of MDA on disease in emergency settings. However, the biological effects of MDA on disease in non-emergency settings are likely to translate to MDA recipients in emergency settings. The size of effect will vary according to the type of emergency and level of disruption to health services, as well as underlying transmission intensity, choice of drug, delivery method and other factors. Practical info See section 4.2.6.1 for the recommendation on MDA for burden reduction for further practical considerations.

More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version. Values and There was no available evidence for assessing preferences or values. The GDG determined that preferences there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in how the main outcomes assessed for MDA are valued across contexts. Resources There was limited evidence on the cost-effectiveness of MDA in emergency settings.

The systematic review aimed to determine whether people residing in malaria-endemic settings during an emergency, in a period of health service disruption, or during a febrile illness epidemic should be given an antimalarial for chemoprevention through MDA. Secondary objectives included summarizing evidence on contextual factors that affect the implementation of MDA in emergencies. Two studies were included in the quantitative assessment – neither of which was a randomized controlled trial. These studies were conducted in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo with, respectively, two rounds of artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) given five weeks apart and two rounds of AS-AQ followed by one round of pyronaridine-artesunate 4–7 weeks apart (Sayreet alunpublished evidence). The evidence was reviewed by the GDG using the Evidence-to-Decision framework in October 2021. The overall certainty of the evidence regarding the use of MDA in emergency settings was low and the complexity of conducting research in emergency settings was noted by the GDG. Despite the limited evidence of MDA impact on disease in emergency settings, the GDG considered that the biological effects of MDA on disease in non-emergency settings would likely translate to MDA recipients in emergency settings. The size of effect will likely vary according to the type of emergency and level of disruption to health services, as well as factors affecting MDA impact such as underlying transmission intensity, delivery method, and other factors. Summary of judgements The GDG determined that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favoured MDA in emergency settings, and resource requirements would likely vary depending on the nature of the emergency and the setting. In addition, the GDG judged that MDA in emergency settings is probably cost-effective; can be feasible, although this will vary depending on the context; would increase health equity; and is probably acceptable to key stakeholders. Consequently, the GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation should be made for MDA in emergency settings, highlighting the strong ethical and moral imperative for malaria prevention in these contexts. Evaluation It is acknowledged that the monitoring and evaluation of MDA in emergencies is particularly challenging. However, programmes should actively consider including systems for monitoring and evaluation to provide evidence for future reviews of this recommendation. 4.2.6.3 MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in very low to low transmission settings 137 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence MDA to reduce transmission ofP. falciparumin very low to low transmission settings (2022) In areas with very low to low levels ofP. falciparumtransmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention through mass drug administration (MDA) to reduce transmission. - MDA may quickly reduce transmission ofP. falciparumin very low to low transmission areas, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months.

Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria elimination programme (including, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance with parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment, and appropriate prevention tools and strategies) in order to reduce the risk of resurgence after the MDA programme has ended. - MDA should be considered only for geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas. - Malaria programmes should consider whether sufficient resources are available to implement MDA without affecting other components of a robust malaria elimination programme. - Very low to low transmission settings are defined as areas withP. falciparumparasite prevalence less than 10%, orP. falciparumincidence less than 250 cases per 1000 population per year[30]. These thresholds should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of MDA implementation for transmission reduction. MDA implemented in areas with levels of transmission near these cut-offs may reduce both disease burden and transmission intensity. Practical info The WHO guidance document,Mass drug administration for falciparum malaria: a practical field manualprovides technical and operational guidance on the practical aspects of organizing a successful MDA program[161]. MDA has been found to have a short-term (1–3 months) impact onP. falciparumtransmission in very low to low transmission areas. For MDA to contribute meaningfully towards achievement of malaria elimination, activities must already be in place to capitalize on the reduction in transmission achieved through the strategy. For that reason, if MDA is implemented, it should be as one component of a robust malaria elimination programme that includes, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance, quality-assured parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment and additional prevention strategies such as vector control. MDA will have maximal benefit to an elimination programme if the aim is to reduce transmission to the level that intensive surveillance and follow-up of every case can begin. MDA is likely to be most effective at reducing transmission in geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas. Additionally, MDA rounds should be scheduled for time periods when populations exhibit low levels of movement in and out of the area in order to increase coverage of the intervention and reduce risk of importation. The impact of MDA will be greater, and last longer, if a large proportion of the population present in the area benefits from the treatment and prophylaxis provided by the medicine and if the rate of parasite importation is low.", "page_start": 138, "page_end": 138, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The impact of MDA will be greater, and last longer, if a large proportion of the population present in the area benefits from the treatment and prophylaxis provided by the medicine and if the rate of parasite importation is low. The frequency of rounds and duration of the MDA programme should take into account the local malaria epidemiology, the length of the prophylactic period provided by the antimalarial used, and the feasibility and cost of delivering each additional round. Consistent with trial data, mathematical models predicted that a single round of MDA would lead to an initial decrease in infections, but that the duration of effect would be short lived. Application of additional rounds is predicted to substantially improve the impact and duration of effect, but attempts should be made in later rounds to reach individuals who did not participate in earlier rounds. Achieving high coverage of the population and good adherence to the antimalarial medicine are critical aspects of MDA programmes. MDA programmes ask many asymptomatic, healthy people to take a medicine when they do not feel ill, with the potential for adverse reactions to occur. Improving coverage and adherence requires development of understanding and trust in the institutions implementing the programme. Community engagement is thus a key factor in determining the success of MDA in order to improve participation rates and adherence to the full treatment course of the medicine. A complete therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine, at doses recommended by the manufacturer, should be given to all eligible adults and children within the defined geographic area. Drug dosage should be determined by weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the person’s weight is unknown. The antimalarial medicines chosen for use in MDA should: a) be WHO recommended and prequalified; b) be efficacious against local parasites; c) be different from the medicine used as first-line treatment, where possible c) have a superior safety and tolerability profile; d) 138 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) provide a longer duration of post-treatment prophylaxis with component medicines that have closely matched pharmacology to reduce the risk of new infections encountering only a single drug; e) have a positive public reputation and acceptability and f) be available and low-cost.

MDA should not be given to individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. seasonal malaria chemoprevention, perennial malaria chemoprevention, or intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy). Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review identified eight community-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) in very low to low transmission settings in six countries (Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, United Republic of Tanzania, Viet Nam, and Zambia) assessing the impact of MDA onP. falciparum to no MDA (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(b)). The time periods for results were grouped as 1–3, 4–12 and 12–24 months after the last round of MDA. The results below report the absolute effects (risk differences) of the intervention, as these were used by the GDG in its judgements; relative effect sizes are available under Research evidence. Immediate-to-short-term benefit 1–3 months after the last round of MDA - MDA probably reducesP. falciparumprevalence (risk difference [RD]: -18 cases per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -20 to -14 per 1000 persons; eight cRCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). - MDA probably reduces the incidence ofP. falciparum(RD: -8 cases per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -10 to -4 per 1000 p-y; one cRCT; moderate-certainty evidence). - MDA may result in little to no difference in the incidence ofP. falciparumclinical malaria (RD: -3 cases per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -5 to 11 per 1000 p-y; two cRCTs; low-certainty evidence). Medium-term benefit 4–12 months after the last round of MDA - MDA may result in little to no difference inP. falciparumprevalence (RD: -3 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -8 to 4 per 1000 persons; six cRCTs; low-certainty evidence). - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the incidence ofP. falciparumclinical malaria (RD: -6 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -9 to 0 per 1000 p-y; four cRCTs; very low-certainty evidence).

Judgement of the panel The GDG noted the difficulty in judging the effect of MDA onP. falciparumin very low to low transmission settings given the small number of studies identified by the systematic review with outcomes of interest and the overall low certainty of the evidence. The GDG assessed the size of the desirable effects to be moderate and the undesirable effects to be small. The GDG judged the balance of effects to probably favour MDA forP. falciparumin areas of very low to low transmission, although there was concern about the sustainability of impact if only one or two rounds are conducted. Certainty of the Low evidence The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be low. Values and No studies were identified regarding preferences and values. preferences The GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in the preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies. Resources The systematic review identified four studies with information on resource needs for MDA (Schneider et alunpublished evidence(b)). The cost of MDA varied from ~US$ 1.04 to US$ 19.40 per person per 140 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) round; one study estimated that drugs accounted for 70% of the cost of MDA. Compared to reactive drug administration (RDA), MDA was superior in all cost-effectiveness measures, including cost per infection averted, cost per case averted, cost per death averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Furthermore, the cost of MDA per person reached was substantially lower in an operational setting (US$ 2.90) than in a research setting (US$ 4.71). The GDG judged the resources required to implement MDA to be large. The GDG found it difficult to judge the cost-effectiveness of MDA as the evidence of an effect was of low certainty, and both the effectiveness and cost of the intervention are likely to vary depending on the time period over which outcomes are measured and whether elimination is achieved. However, the GDG concluded that cost-effectiveness in very low to low transmission areas probably favoured the intervention. Equity No studies were identified that addressed the issue of whether MDA increased or decreased health equity. The GDG judged that the impact of MDA on equity is likely to vary.

Equity No studies were identified that addressed the issue of whether MDA increased or decreased health equity. The GDG judged that the impact of MDA on equity is likely to vary. While MDA has the potential to reach people who might have difficulty accessing other malaria prevention and treatment services, MDA might also expose many people to antimalarials who were not infected. The GDG felt that MDA could exacerbate inequity if not implemented appropriately or if implementation resulted in only a small, temporary effect. However, if implementation of MDA contributed to elimination ofP. falciparum, then the intervention would likely improve equity. Acceptability The systematic review identified 18 studies with information on acceptability (Schneideret al unpublished evidence(b)). The most common barrier to acceptability of MDA reported in the literature was fear of adverse events. Two studies found that participants were concerned that adverse events from MDA might inhibit their economic productivity, although in another study respondents felt that malaria infection was more likely to limit economic activity than adverse events from MDA. One study found that, in addition to sensitization on the benefits of MDA, providing healthcare to communities participating in MDA helped to reduce concerns about adverse effects; however, another study found that the presence of expatriate physicians, an ambulance, and the unfamiliar informed consent process elevated rather than reduced concerns. Previous experience reinforced initial perceptions of MDA: individuals who had been part of previous MDA trials shared stories in their communities; if those experiences were poor, community members had negative impressions of MDA. In areas where other malaria interventions had been implemented effectively, MDA for malaria was viewed more positively. One study found that reported acceptability of MDA increased from 62% before the intervention to 98% after, while the proportion of respondents who answered that MDA could cause side effects decreased from 30% to 20% in the same timeframe. Common themes in analyses of drivers of acceptance were sensitization or education about the intervention, support from a range of local authority figures, and additional health support. One study reported that “Respondents who felt that they have received enough information... were more likely to participate in all rounds of MDA,” a theme that was reiterated in five other studies. One study found that a lack of engagement with local healthcare providers limited adherence due to conflicting messages around the efficacy of MDA. The GDG judged the acceptability of MDA forP. falciparumin very low to low transmission settings to vary depending on whether factors that affect community and individual acceptability have been appropriately addressed in the design of the intervention.

The GDG suggested that a key consideration was whether malaria programme staff find MDA to be an acceptable intervention, but no surveys of this key stakeholder were identified. Feasibility The systematic review identified 13 studies providing information on the feasibility of implementation of MDA (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(b)). Ten studies described barriers to implementing 141 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) MDA due to residents’ absence. Of these, three studies noted that absenteeism was one of the major driving forces of non-adherence to medicine. One study noted that determining participants’ seasonal mobility prior to the MDA campaign had contributed to the success of the campaign. Three studies noted difficulties related to determining the optimal timing of the MDA campaign: weather-related challenges, agricultural activities, overlaps with religious events, especially those involving fasting, unpredictable policy changes at the national level and the school year. Feasibility concerns related to participants’ religion were further noted in one study that attempted to implement directly observed drug administration but found that some women were unwilling to remove their face coverings in front of strangers. This issue was resolved by creating sequestered administration sites staffed by accepted local staff. The GDG judged the feasibility of implementing MDA to vary depending on the size of the population, with improved feasibility in smaller populations and island communities. Justification The systematic review of the impact of MDA onP. falciparumidentified significant heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of a key outcome (prevalence of infection 1–3 months after the last round of MDA) (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(b)). A subgroup analysis found that the heterogeneity between studies could be explained by differences between higher and lower transmission settings. In the systematic review, a cut-off of 10% prevalence ofP. falciparuminfection and incidence of 250P. falciparumcases per 1000 population per year was used to differentiate between areas of very low to low transmission and areas of moderate to high transmission. As higher transmission settings have a larger parasite reservoir, higher rate of new infections and often greater vectorial capacity than lower transmission settings, it is biologically plausible for MDA to have a differential impact on transmission reduction depending on the transmission setting. As a result, the systematic review stratified all analyses by transmission setting, and separate recommendations were developed on the use of MDA for reducing transmission ofP. falciparumin very low to low and moderate to high transmission areas. The GDG concluded that the balance of effects probably favoured implementation of MDA to reduceP. falciparum transmission in very low to low transmission settings although there were concerns about the sustainability of impact if only one", "page_start": 141, "page_end": 142, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation for MDA forP. falciparumin very low to low transmission settings should be issued given the moderate-certainty evidence for a short-term benefit, variability around issues such as acceptability and feasibility and large resource requirements. Research needs - Further evidence is needed on the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) and potential harms/unintended consequences of MDA forP. falciparumin very low to low transmission areas, including resistance to antimalarial medicines. Evidence of impact disaggregated by sex, age and socioeconomic status is needed to understand whether there are any equity considerations. - Determine the optimal timing and number of MDA rounds to maximize the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA onP. falciparumin very low to low transmission areas. - Determine the minimum effective coverage of MDA in the population to maximize the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA onP. falciparumin very low to low transmission areas. - Determine whether multiple years of effective coverage of MDA as part of an elimination programme is feasible and acceptable and whether it can contribute to interruptingP. falciparumtransmission in very low to low transmission areas. - Investigate approaches to improving the acceptability of MDA and adherence to antimalarial medicines in very low to low transmission areas. - Determine whether the addition of single, low-dose primaquine modifies the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA onP. falciparumin very low to low transmission areas. 4.2.6.4 MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in moderate to high transmission settings 142 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation against , Very low certainty evidence MDA to reduce transmission ofP. falciparumin moderate to high", "page_start": 142, "page_end": 143, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Moderate to high transmission settings are defined as areas withP. falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10%, orP. falciparumincidence above 250 cases per 1000 population per year[30]. These thresholds should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of MDA. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review identified two cRCTs and two nonrandomised studies (NRSs) in moderate to high transmission settings in four countries (Burkina Faso, Gambia, Nigeria and Zambia) assessing the impact of MDA onP. falciparumcompared to no MDA (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(b)). The time periods for results were grouped as 1–3, 4–12 and 12–24 months after the last round of MDA; cRCTs and NRS were analysed and GRADEd separately.

Judgement of the panel The GDG noted the difficulty in judging the effect of MDA onP. falciparumin moderate to high transmission settings given how few studies with the outcomes of interest were identified by the systematic review and the overall very low certainty of evidence. The GDG judged that the sizes of both the desirable and undesirable effects were small, and the balance of effects probably did not favour MDA to reduce transmission ofP. falciparumin moderate to high transmission settings. In addition, the GDG was concerned that any impact of MDA would be very short-lived in a moderate to high transmission setting. Certainty of the Very low evidence The overall certainty of evidence was judged to be very low. Values and No studies were identified regarding preferences and values. preferences The GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies. Resources The systematic review identified four studies with information on resource needs for MDA (Schneider et alunpublished evidence(b)). The cost of MDA varied from ~US$ 1.04 to US$ 19.40 per person per round; one study estimated that drugs accounted for 70% of the cost of MDA.

Compared to reactive drug administration (RDA), MDA was superior in all cost-effectiveness measures, including cost per infection averted, cost per case averted, cost per death averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Furthermore, the cost of MDA per person reached was substantially lower in an operational setting (US$ 2.90) than in a research setting (US$ 4.71). The GDG judged the resources required to implement MDA to be large. The GDG judged that cost- effectiveness probably favoured no MDA but found it difficult to judge the cost-effectiveness of MDA as the evidence for an effect was of very low certainty and both the effectiveness and cost of the intervention are likely to vary depending on the time period over which they are measured. Equity The systematic review did not identify any research that addressed the issue of how MDA affects health equity. The GDG judged the impact of implementing MDA on equity to vary. While MDA had the potential to reach people who might have difficulty accessing other malaria prevention and treatment services, it also exposes uninfected people to the potential adverse effects of antimalarials. The GDG felt that MDA could exacerbate inequity if not implemented appropriately or if implementation resulted only in a small, temporary effect. Acceptability The systematic review identified 18 studies with information on acceptability (Schneideret al unpublished evidence(b)). The most common barrier to acceptability of MDA reported in the literature was fear of adverse events. Two studies found that participants were concerned that adverse events 144 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) from MDA might inhibit their economic productivity, although in another study respondents felt that malaria infection was more likely to limit economic activity than adverse events. One study found that, in addition to sensitization on the benefits of MDA, providing healthcare to communities participating in MDA helped to reduce concerns about adverse effects; however, another study found that the presence of expatriate physicians, an ambulance, and the unfamiliar informed consent process elevated rather than reduced concerns. Previous experience reinforced initial perceptions of MDA: individuals who had been part of previous MDA trials shared stories in their communities; if those experiences were poor, community members had negative impressions of MDA. In areas where other malaria interventions had been implemented effectively, MDA for malaria was viewed more positively. One study found that reported acceptability of MDA increased from 62% before the intervention to 98% after, while the proportion of respondents who answered that MDA could cause side effects decreased from 30% to 20% in the same timeframe. Common themes in analyses of drivers of acceptance were sensitization or education about the intervention, support from a range of local authority figures, and additional health support.

Common themes in analyses of drivers of acceptance were sensitization or education about the intervention, support from a range of local authority figures, and additional health support. One study reported that “Respondents who felt that they have received enough information... were more likely to participate in all rounds of MDA,” a theme that was reiterated in five other studies. One study found that a lack of engagement with local healthcare providers limited adherence due to conflicting messages around the efficacy of MDA. The GDG judged the acceptability of MDA forP. falciparumin moderate to high transmission settings to depend on whether factors that affect community and individual acceptability have been appropriately addressed in the design of the intervention. The GDG considered that a country’s previous experience with MDA, whether positive or negative, was likely to affect their level of acceptance of the intervention. The GDG suggested that a key consideration was whether malaria programme staff find MDA to be an acceptable intervention, but no surveys of this key stakeholder were identified. Feasibility The systematic review identified 13 studies providing information on the feasibility of implementation of MDA (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(b)). Ten studies described barriers to implementing MDA due to residents’ absence. Of these, three studies noted that absenteeism was one of the major driving forces of non-adherence to medicine. One study noted that determining participants’ seasonal mobility prior to the MDA campaign had contributed to the success of the campaign. Three studies noted difficulties related to determining the optimal timing of the MDA campaign: weather-related challenges, agricultural activities, overlaps with religious events, especially those involving fasting, unpredictable policy changes at the national level and the school year. Feasibility concerns related to participants’ religion were further noted in one study that attempted to implement directly observed drug administration but found that some women were unwilling to remove their face coverings in front of strangers. This issue was resolved by creating sequestered administration sites staffed by accepted local staff. The GDG judged the feasibility of implementing MDA to vary depending on the size of the population, with improved feasibility in smaller populations and island communities. Justification The GDG judged that the balance of effects probably favoured not implementing MDA to reduceP. falciparumtransmission in moderate to high transmission settings.

The GDG judged that the acceptability of the intervention was likely to vary depending on the stakeholder group and previous experience of the population with MDA. The feasibility of implementing the intervention was judged to vary depending on the size of the population to be covered. The GDG concluded that there should be a conditional recommendation against the implementation of MDA to reduce transmission ofP. falciparumin moderate to high transmission settings given the lack of evidence for either a short- or long-term benefit, variability around issues such as acceptability and feasibility and large resource requirements. 145 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 4.2.6.5 MDA to reduce transmission of P. vivax Conditional recommendation for , Very low certainty evidence MDA to reduce transmission ofP. vivax(2022) In areas withP. vivaxtransmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention through mass drug administration (MDA) to reduce transmission. - MDA may quickly reduce transmission ofP. vivax,but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria elimination programme (including, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance with parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment including treatment for hypnozoites, and appropriate prevention tools and strategies) in order to reduce the risk of resurgence after the MDA programme has ended. - MDA should be considered only for geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas. - Malaria programmes should consider whether sufficient resources are available to implement MDA without affecting other components of a robust malaria elimination programme. - Programmes considering implementing MDA forP. vivaxshould carefully reflect on how to safely and feasibly administer treatment to prevent relapses. Practical info MDA without an 8-aminoquinoline medicine may have a short-term (1–3 months) impact onP. vivaxtransmission. For MDA to contribute meaningfully towards achievement of malaria elimination, activities must already be in place to capitalize on the reduction in transmission achieved through the strategy. For that reason, MDA should be implemented as a component of a robust malaria elimination programme that includes, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance, quality-assured parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment and additional prevention strategies such as vector control. MDA will have maximal benefit to an elimination programme if the aim is to reduce transmission to the level that intensive surveillance and follow-up of every case can begin. MDA is likely to be most effective at reducing transmission in geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas.

MDA is likely to be most effective at reducing transmission in geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas. Additionally, MDA rounds should be scheduled for time periods when populations exhibit low levels of movement in and out of the area in order to increase coverage of the intervention and reduce risk of importation. The impact of MDA will be greater, and last longer, if a large proportion of the population present in the area benefits from the treatment and prophylaxis provided by the medicine and if the rate of parasite importation is low. The frequency of rounds and duration of the MDA programme should take into account the local malaria epidemiology, the half-life of the antimalarial used, and the feasibility and cost of delivering each additional round. Consistent with trial data, mathematical models predicted that a single round of MDA would lead to an initial decrease in infections, but that the duration of effect would be short lived. Application of additional rounds is predicted to substantially improve the impact and duration of effect. Achieving high coverage of the population and good adherence to the antimalarial medicine are critical aspects of MDA programmes. MDA programmes ask many asymptomatic, healthy people to take a medicine when they do not feel ill, with the potential for adverse reactions to occur. Improving coverage and adherence requires development of understanding and trust in the institutions implementing the programme. Community engagement is thus a key factor in determining the success of MDA, to improve participation rates and adherence to the full treatment course of the medicine. A complete therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine, at doses recommended by the manufacturer, should be given to all eligible adults and children within the defined geographic area. Drug dosage should be determined by weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the person’s weight is unknown. The antimalarial medicines chosen for use in MDA should: a) be WHO recommended and prequalified; b) be efficacious against local parasites; c) be different from the medicine used as first-line treatment, where possible c) have a superior safety and tolerability profile; d) provide a longer duration of post-treatment prophylaxis with component medicines that have closely matched pharmacology to reduce the risk of new infections encountering only a single drug; e) have a positive public reputation and acceptability and f) 146 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) be available and low-cost.

A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly-observed single dose is preferred to multi-day regimens. Depending on the medicine chosen, certain population groups may need to be excluded from MDA, such as: pregnant women in their first trimester; infants < 6 months of age or weighing <5kgs; people recently treated with the same medicine; people with a known allergy to the medicine; anyone with severe acute illness or unable to take oral medication; people taking medication known to interact with the medicine used for MDA; and people with specific contraindications to the medicine used[161]. MDA should not be given to individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. seasonal malaria chemoprevention, perennial malaria chemoprevention, or intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy). MDA forP. vivaxis complicated because manyP. vivaxinfections are likely to be dormant stages (hypnozoites) in the liver that will not be cured unless an 8-amnoquinoline, the only type of medicine that treats hypnozoites, is administered. Without provision of an 8-aminoquinoline, a large proportion ofP. vivaxcases treated in the MDA programme will relapse within a few months. However, programmes contemplating providing medicine for radical cure ofP. vivaxas part of MDA should carefully consider whether it is feasible to administer this treatment regimen safely, i.e. with testing for G6PD deficiency prior to treatment, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. Programmes should also consider whether sufficient coverage and adherence to the full course of radical cure can be achieved. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review identified five cRCTs and six NRSs in eight countries (Cambodia, India, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Panama, Solomon Islands, Venezuela [Bolivarian Republic of] and Viet Nam) assessing the impact of MDA onP. vivaxtransmission to no MDA (Schneideret al unpublished evidence(b)). None of the cRCTs and only one of the NRSs used sufficient dosage of an 8-aminoquinoline to achieve radical cure ofP. vivaxhypnozoites1. The time periods for results were grouped as 1–3, 4–12 and 12–24 months after the last round of MDA.

Judgement of the panel The GDG noted that there were important differences between the few studies included in the systematic review in terms of the background level of malaria transmission and other factors, which complicated the assessment of the balance of benefits and harms. Only one of the NRSs and none of the cRCTs identified by the systematic review used sufficient dosage of an 8-aminoquinoline for radical cure of theP. vivaxhypnozoite reservoir. The GDG noted that the balance of effects could be different if radical cure ofP. vivaxwas attempted as part of MDA. While a greater impact of MDA on P. vivaxwould be expected if relapses were prevented through treatment of hypnozoites, potential harms might increase from exposure of G6PD deficient individuals to an 8-aminoquinoline. Levels of acceptability and feasibility might decrease given the need to test for G6PD deficiency, establish or maintain an effective pharmacovigilance system and provide emergency access to blood transfusion services. Therefore, the GDG noted that there was limited evidence on the benefits and harms of including radical cure as part of MDA forP. vivaxto inform the recommendation. Cognizant of the limitations of the available evidence, the GDG judged that the sizes of both the desirable and undesirable effects were small, and the balance of effects did not favour either MDA or no MDA forP. vivax. 1The systematic review considered the following as the minimum adult dosage of 8-aminoquinoline medicines to achieve radical cure: 210 mg of primaquine over eight weeks; 1.25 g of plasmochin over 14 days. One study considered its primaquine adult dosage regimen (40 mg of primaquine every two weeks for two years) to be radical cure, but as the total dose for an eight-week period (i.e. 160 mg) was less than 210 mg, the systematic review did not consider this to be radical cure (Schneider et alunpublished evidence(b)).

The cost of MDA varied from ~US$ 1.04 to US$ 19.40 per person per round; one study estimated that drugs accounted for 70% of the cost of MDA. Compared to reactive drug administration (RDA), MDA was superior in all cost-effectiveness measures, including cost per infection averted, cost per case averted, cost per death averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Furthermore, the cost of MDA per person reached was substantially lower in an operational setting (US$ 2.90) than in a research setting (US$ 4.71). The GDG judged the resources required to implement MDA to be large. The GDG found it difficult to judge the cost-effectiveness of MDA as there were no data on cost or cost-effectiveness identified in the studies ofP. vivax. The GDG judged that the effectiveness and cost of MDA are likely to vary depending on the time period over which they are measured and whether elimination is achieved. Equity The systematic review did not identify any research that addressed the issue of how MDA affects health equity. The GDG judged the impact of implementing MDA on equity to vary. While MDA had the potential to reach people who might have difficulty accessing other malaria prevention and treatment services, it also exposes uninfected people to the potential adverse effects of antimalarials. The GDG felt that MDA could exacerbate inequity if not implemented appropriately or if implementation resulted only in a small, temporary effect. Acceptability The systematic review identified 18 studies with information on acceptability (Schneideret al unpublished evidence(b)). The most common barrier to acceptability of MDA reported in the literature was fear of adverse events. Two studies found that participants were concerned that adverse events from MDA might inhibit their economic productivity, although in another study respondents felt that malaria infection was more likely to limit economic activity than adverse events. One study found that, in addition to sensitization on the benefits of MDA, providing healthcare to communities participating in MDA helped to reduce concerns about adverse effects; however, another study found that the presence of expatriate physicians, an ambulance, and the unfamiliar informed consent process elevated rather than reduced concerns. Previous experience reinforced initial perceptions of MDA: individuals who had been part of previous MDA trials shared stories in their communities; if those experiences were poor, community members had negative impressions of MDA. In areas where other malaria interventions had been implemented effectively, MDA for malaria was viewed more positively. One study found that reported acceptability of MDA increased from 62% before the intervention to 98% after, while the proportion of respondents who answered that MDA could cause side effects decreased from 30%", "page_start": 149, "page_end": 149, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

In areas where other malaria interventions had been implemented effectively, MDA for malaria was viewed more positively. One study found that reported acceptability of MDA increased from 62% before the intervention to 98% after, while the proportion of respondents who answered that MDA could cause side effects decreased from 30% to 20% in the same timeframe. Common themes in analyses of drivers of acceptance were sensitization or education about the intervention, support from a range of local authority figures, and additional health support. One study reported that “Respondents who felt that they have received enough information... were more likely to participate in all rounds of MDA,” a theme that was reiterated in five other studies. One study found that a lack of engagement with local healthcare providers limited adherence due to conflicting messages around the efficacy of MDA. The GDG judged that the acceptability of MDA forP. vivaxwould vary depending on whether factors that affect community and individual acceptability have been appropriately addressed in the design of the intervention. The GDG considered that a country’s previous experience with MDA, whether positive or negative, was likely to affect their level of acceptance of the intervention. The GDG suggested that a key consideration is whether malaria programme staff find MDA to be an acceptable intervention, but no surveys of this key stakeholder were identified. The GDG felt that the inclusion of an 8-aminoquinoline in MDA for radical cure would likely have a negative effect on the acceptability of the intervention due to safety concerns and the long treatment period. 149 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Feasibility The systematic review identified 13 studies providing information on the feasibility of implementation of MDA (Schneideret alunpublished evidence(b)). Ten studies described barriers to implementing MDA due to residents’ absence. Of these, three studies noted that absenteeism was one of the major driving forces of non-adherence to medicine. One study noted that determining participants’ seasonal mobility prior to the MDA campaign had contributed to the success of the campaign. Three studies noted difficulties related to determining the optimal timing of the MDA campaign: weather-related challenges, agricultural activities, overlaps with religious events, especially those involving fasting, unpredictable policy changes at the national level and the school year. Feasibility concerns related to participants’ religion were further noted in one study that attempted to implement directly observed drug administration but found that some women were unwilling to remove their face coverings in front of strangers. This issue was resolved by creating sequestered administration sites staffed by accepted local staff.

This issue was resolved by creating sequestered administration sites staffed by accepted local staff. The GDG judged the feasibility of implementing MDA forP. vivaxto vary depending on the size of the population, with improved feasibility in smaller populations and island communities. Feasibility would also vary depending on whether radical cure using an 8-aminoquinoline medicine was part of the MDA strategy, which would necessitate testing for G6PD deficiency, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. Justification The GDG concluded that the balance of effects did not favour either MDA or no MDA to reduceP. vivaxtransmission. There was a lack of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of MDA drug regimens that included an 8-aminoquinoline for radical cure ofP. vivax; the GDG expressed concern both for the likely decreased long-term effectiveness of MDA forP. vivaxwithout use of an 8-aminoquinoline and the increased complexity of safely administering 8-aminoquinolines. The GDG judged that the resources required for implementation of MDA were large and could impact negatively on the implementation of other recommended malaria strategies. While cost-effectiveness data were limited, the GDG judged that cost-effectiveness probably favoured MDA to reduceP. vivaxtransmission but would depend on the time period over which it was measured and whether elimination was achieved. The GDG judged that the acceptability of the intervention was likely to vary depending on the stakeholder group, the population’s previous experience with MDA and whether radical cure with an 8-aminoquinoline was included. The feasibility of implementing the intervention was judged to vary depending on the size of the population to be covered and whether radical cure, with the need for G6PD deficiency testing, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services, was included in the MDA programme. The GDG concluded that MDA could be a useful intervention if it reducedP. vivaxtransmission quickly to enable the initiation of intensive surveillance activities. The GDG therefore proposed a conditional recommendation for the use of MDA forP. vivax. Research needs - Further evidence is needed on the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) and potential harms/ unintended consequences of MDA forP. vivax. - Evidence is needed on the acceptability, feasibility, impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) and potential harms/unintended consequences (death, hospital admission, severe anaemia or any severe adverse event) of safe provision (including testing for G6PD deficiency and, additionally, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services) of an 8-aminoquinoline as part of MDA for radical cure ofP. vivax. - Determine the optimal timing and number of MDA rounds to maximize the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA onP. vivax. - Determine the minimum effective coverage of MDA in the population to maximize the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA", "page_start": 150, "page_end": 150, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

However, conducting G6PD testing for a large population would significantly add to the complexity and cost of the intervention. - The GDG noted that there may be highly exceptional circumstances under which mass relapse prevention (MRP) may be appropriate, such as during a small focal outbreak ofP. vivaxin a temperate area. However, under such circumstances the GDG considered that an MDA programme providing a schizonticide in addition to an 8-aminoquinoline would likely be a better strategy. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review identified two NRSs that provided data on MRP forP. vivax(Shahet al unpublished evidence). Studies were conducted in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in 2002 and in the Republic of Azerbaijan in 1970–1971. Both studies provided primaquine for 14 days at 0.25 mg/kg per day, administered in a single round prior to the peak transmission season. The results below report the absolute effects (risk differences) of the intervention, as these were used by the GDG in its judgements; relative effect sizes are available in the Research evidence.

Adverse events - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MRP on adverse events (one NRS; very low- certainty evidence). Judgement of the panel The GDG could not judge the size of the beneficial effects given the very low certainty of the evidence. However, the GDG was clear that there was the potential for large undesirable effects, given the possibility of severe haemolysis among people with G6PD deficiency who take an 8-aminoquinoline. Overall, the GDG judged the balance of effects to probably favour no MRP.

Resources No studies were identified on the costs of implementing MRP. The GDG judged the costs were likely to be large. Equity No studies were identified addressing the issue of whether MRP increased or decreased health equity. The GDG judged that equity might be reduced by MRP, given that the undesirable effects were likely to be focalized in a healthy subgroup of the population with G6PD deficiency. Acceptability No studies were identified on the acceptability of MRP. The GDG was unable to judge whether or not the intervention was acceptable. Feasibility The systematic review identified one study on the feasibility of implementing MRP, which provided information on the size and composition of implementation teams and how adverse events were identified and managed (Shahet alunpublished evidence). The GDG judged that population screening for G6PD deficiency, along with an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services, would be needed to implement MRP safely, which would significantly increase the complexity and cost of the intervention. Justification The GDG was disappointed in the very low quality of evidence to judge the impact of MRP onP. vivaxtransmission. The GDG judged that the balance of effects probably favoured no MRP while the feasibility of implementing an MRP programme was very low given the complexity of safely administering radical cure forP. vivaxhypnozoites, which would entail a high cost. Additionally, the GDG was concerned that the MRP strategy does not include an antimalarial medicine that targets blood-stage parasites (i.e. schizonticide), given evidence for improved efficacy of primaquine against relapses when co-administered with a schizonticide.

Research needs The GDG suggested that the strategy could be reconsidered if a new drug to treat hypnozoites was developed that could be administered without the need for G6PD testing. 4.3 Vaccines The use of vaccines for the prevention of malaria Immunization has been one of the major success stories for global health and development. Since 1974, vaccination has averted 154 million deaths, with 95% of these in children younger than 5 years of age[162]. Since 2010, at least 116 countries have introduced vaccines they did not previously use, including those against major killers such as pneumococcal pneumonia, diarrhoea, cervical cancer, typhoid, cholera and meningitis. Today, more than 20 life-threatening diseases can now be prevented through immunization. Vaccines are trusted interventions delivered through an effective platform that reaches children with high coverage; in 2023, nearly 85% of infants were vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP dose 3)[163].Vaccination has accounted for 40% of the observed decline in global infant mortality (52% in the WHO African Region) since 1974. As a result of 50 years of vaccination, a child born today has a 40% increase in survival for each year of infancy and childhood[162]. 152 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Vaccines have the potential to extend the reach of malaria prevention tools. During the introduction of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine under theMalaria Vaccine Implementation Programme(MVIP), more than two thirds of children who reportedly did not sleep under an insecticide-treated net (ITN) received at least one dose of RTS,S/AS01. Overall, vaccine introduction increased the proportion of children with access to one or more malaria prevention tools (ITNs or malaria vaccines) to over 90%. Vaccine uptake was equitable by sex and socioeconomic status and had no negative effects on the uptake of other childhood vaccinations, ITN use or health-seeking behaviour for febrile illness (Full evidence report on the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine,unpublished evidence). Malaria vaccine pipeline Two malaria vaccines are WHO-prequalified and recommended for use: RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M. Both are pre-erythrocytic vaccines that preventP. falciparuminfection and subsequent illness and death in children; the vaccines are not designed to interrupt malaria transmission.

However, in areas whereP. falciparumand otherPlasmodiumspecies, includingP. vivax, are endemic, the vaccine can provide important protection againstP. falciparummalaria. A number of additional malaria vaccine candidates are currently in the research pipeline at different stages of clinical development, including other vaccines that also target the pre-erythrocytic stage[164][165].More recently, vaccine development efforts have also targeted the blood stage (erythrocytic)[166], sexual-stage antigens for the prevention of human-to-mosquito malaria transmission[167], and other malaria species such asP. vivax. New technologies, such as DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines[168][169][170], and the ongoing development of adjuvants[171], are being explored for use in malaria vaccines. In 2014, WHO published guidelines on the quality, safety and efficacy of recombinant malaria vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic and blood stages ofP. falciparum[172]. National programmes for immunization and malaria Malaria vaccines should be provided as part of a comprehensive malaria control strategy. All malaria control interventions, including vaccines, provide partial protection; the highest impact is achieved when a mix of interventions is used. Appropriate mixes of interventions (ITNs, preventive chemotherapies, vaccines, etc.) should be identified for different subnational settings. These mixes are defined by national malaria programmes (NMPs) on the basis of the local malaria epidemiology (e.g. intensity of transmission, age pattern of severe disease, vector species and behaviour, and insecticide and drug resistance patterns) and contextual factors (e.g. structure and function of the health care system). Malaria vaccines should be integrated into relevant immunization guidelines and malaria control strategies, including national strategic plans to define the package of interventions needed to optimize malaria control and elimination in a country. WHO is developing operational guidance on principles for the subnational tailoring of malaria interventions. Country considerations and planning for malaria vaccine introduction should rely on data-driven decision-making in which NMP and Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) staff consider parasite prevalence, disease burden, existing malaria interventions, vaccine delivery, the logistics, strength and support of the immunization programme, and the availability of funding support, among other factors. Decision-making on whether to adopt and implement the malaria vaccine should involve close collaboration among the NMP, EPI and other relevant ministry of health departments. In the countries involved in the pilot implementation of RTS,S/AS01, NMPs actively participated in the vaccine introduction and implementation activities in order to ensure that malaria control perspectives were incorporated and to maximize opportunities for integration. Malaria vaccine technical working groups were established with joint participation of EPI and NMPs to provide technical guidance on decision-making and a forum for alignment. EPI leads the logistics of vaccine roll-out and delivery to relevant health facilities.

Both fixed sites for vaccination at health care facilities and opportunities for mobile vaccination delivery or outreach services should be considered. To increase uptake, periodic mass vaccination campaigns or periodic intensified routine immunization activities can be deployed. Monitoring of coverage levels occurs through routine health facility data; the malaria vaccine can be integrated into the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) platform alongside NMP and EPI indicators.

However, countries may also consider providing the vaccine in low transmission settings. Decisions on expanding malaria vaccination to low transmission settings should be considered at country level on the basis of the overall malaria control strategy, affordability, cost-effectiveness and programmatic considerations, such as whether the inclusion would simplify delivery. - Malaria vaccines should be provided in a four-dose schedule in children from 5 months of age for the reduction of malaria disease and burden [ii]. Countries may choose to give the first vaccine dose earlier than 5 months of age on the basis of operational considerations to increase coverage or impact. - The minimum interval between any doses is four weeks; however, to achieve prolonged protection, the fourth dose should be given 6–18 months after the third dose. - To improve coverage, there can be flexibility in the timing of the fourth dose, including by aligning it with vaccines given in the second year of life. Alternatively, because the vaccine efficacy is highest in the first months after vaccination, the fourth dose can be given just prior to seasonal peaks in malaria transmission to optimize vaccine efficacy. - A fifth dose, given one year after the fourth dose, may be provided in areas of highly seasonal transmission and may be considered in other areas where a significant malaria risk remains for children, depending on a local assessment of feasibility and cost-effectiveness. - In", "page_start": 153, "page_end": 154, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Alternatively, countries could consider a hybrid of these approaches, giving the first three doses through age-based administration and subsequent annual doses seasonally [iii]. - At the time of vaccine introduction, catch-up vaccination can be considered in children up to 5 years of age, subject to local epidemiology and age of high risk, feasibility, affordability and vaccine availability. - Malaria vaccines should be provided as part of a comprehensive malaria control strategy. All malaria control interventions, including vaccines, provide partial protection; the highest impact is achieved when a mix of interventions is used. Appropriate mixes of interventions (ITNs, preventive chemotherapies, vaccines, etc.) should be identified for different subnational settings.

[i] Moderate and high transmission settings are defined as areas with aP. falciparumparasite prevalence greater than 10%PfPR2-10or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 cases per 1000 population. These thresholds are indicative and should not be regarded as absolutes for determining the applicability of the malaria vaccine recommendation. [ii] Although the WHO prequalification issued for the RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccines permits children to receive the first dose from 5 months of age, the RTS,S/AS01 manufacturer’s licensure specifies from 6 weeks to 17 months of age. Studies with RTS,S/AS01 indicated lower efficacy if the first dose was given around 6 weeks of age. However, the efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M vaccines is unlikely to be reduced substantially if the first dose is given at 4, rather than 5, months of age.

Practical info Vaccine characteristics, content, dosage, administration and storage RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M are pre-erythrocytic vaccines targeting the central repeat amino acid sequence Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro (NANP) region of theP. falciparumcircumsporozoite protein (CSP). Both vaccines are recombinant protein virus-like particles formed from a fusion protein comprising the CSP region and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (hBsAg) nanoparticles. This recombinant fusion protein is produced through expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiaefor RTS,S andHansenula polymorphafor R21). The formulation of RTS,S/AS01 consists of 25 μg of RTS,S with the AS01 adjuvant system. This adjuvant system contains the immunomodulatory molecules 3-O-desacyl-f4-monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin derived from the bark of the Quillaja saponaria tree (QS21) together with liposomes. The RTS,S antigen is lyophilized and needs to be reconstituted with the liquid AS01 adjuvant suspension prior to administration. The vaccine is produced as a two-dose RTS,S powder to be reconstituted with a two-dose AS01 adjuvant suspension. After reconstitution, the total volume is 1 mL (two doses of 0.5 mL each).[186] R21/Matrix-M consists of 5 μg of R21 and 50 μg of Matrix-M, a saponin-derived adjuvant, and is available as a fully liquid single-vial formulation. Each R21/Matrix-M dose is 0.5 mL, with one-dose and two-dose vials available.[187] 154 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Neither of the vaccines includes a preservative, and vials should therefore be discarded at the end of the vaccination session or within six hours of opening, whichever comes first. The vaccines should be stored at 2–8°C. The shelf-life is three years for RTS,S/AS01 and two years for R21/Matrix-M. A vaccine vial monitor (VVM Type 14) is on the RTS,S/AS01 reconstitution vial and the R21/Matrix-M vial cap.[186][187] Schedule Malaria vaccines should be provided in a four-dose schedule in children from 5 months of age for the reduction of malaria disease and burden.

To improve coverage, there can be flexibility in the timing of the fourth dose, including by aligning it with vaccines given in the second year of life. Alternatively, because vaccine efficacy is highest in the first months after vaccination, the fourth dose can be given just prior to seasonal peaks in malaria transmission to optimize vaccine efficacy.

A fifth dose, given one year after the fourth dose, may be provided in areas of highly seasonal transmission and, depending on a local assessment of feasibility and cost-effectiveness, may be considered in other areas where a significant malaria risk remains for children. In areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission or perennial malaria transmission with seasonal peaks, countries may consider providing the vaccine using an age-based or seasonal approach. Alternatively, countries could consider a hybrid of these approaches, giving the first three doses through age-based administration and subsequent annual doses seasonally. At the time of vaccine introduction, catch-up vaccination can be considered in children up to 5 years of age, subject to local epidemiology and age of high risk, feasibility, affordability and vaccine availability. [iv] Although the WHO prequalification issued for the RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccines permits children to receive the first dose from 5 months of age, the RTS,S/AS01 manufacturer’s licensure specifies from 6 weeks to 17 months of age. Studies with RTS,S/AS01 indicated lower efficacy if the first dose was given around 6 weeks of age. However, the efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M vaccines is unlikely to be reduced substantially if the first dose is given at 4, rather than 5, months of age. Alternative schedules, fractional or reduced-dose schedules To date, efficacy has been demonstrated for a total of seven seasonally targeted doses of RTS,S/AS01 over five high transmission seasons, given as three monthly doses followed by annual doses just prior to the subsequent four high transmission seasons[191]. Efficacy has also been demonstrated for four seasonally targeted doses of R21/Matrix-M over two high transmission seasons[182]. A clinical trial explored alternative vaccine schedules for RTS,S/AS01, including the use of a fractional third and fourth dose to increase vaccine efficacy or for dose-sparing[192][193]. The trial did not show superiority of fractional-dose schedules over the full- dose schedules, although all regimens demonstrated statistically significant vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria compared to the comparator arm (rabies vaccine). The value of the fourth dose is being further evaluated with RTS,S/AS01 as part of the pilot evaluations in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi and in an ongoing case-control study (NCT05041556)[194]. Product choice The choice of product to be used in a country should be based on the product characteristics and programmatic considerations, as well as vaccine supply and long-term affordability. Interchangeability The malaria vaccination series for each child should be completed with the same product whenever feasible. However, if the product used for a prior dose is unavailable or unknown, the series should be completed with either of the available WHO-recommended malaria vaccines.

Restarting the vaccine series is not recommended. Co-administration 155 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) RTS,S/AS01 given in conjunction with routine childhood vaccines has been evaluated in several trials[195][196]. Non-inferiority criteria were met for all vaccines given with RTS,S/AS01, compared to the same vaccines given without RTS,S/AS01. RTS,S/AS01 can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, whole-cell pertussis, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B,Haemophilus influenzaetype b, oral poliovirus, measles, rubella, yellow fever, rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines[178]. A study is currently under way to assess the safety and immunogenicity of R21/Matrix-M co- administered with yellow fever and measles-rubella vaccine and pentavalent (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzaetype b), rotavirus, pneumococcal and oral poliovirus vaccines (NCT05155579)[197]. Role of the malaria vaccine among other preventive measures Malaria vaccines should be provided as part of a comprehensive malaria control strategy. All malaria control interventions, including vaccines, provide partial protection; the highest impact is achieved when a mix of interventions is used. Appropriate mixes of interventions (ITNs, preventive chemotherapies, vaccines, etc.) should be identified for different subnational settings. These mixes are defined by national malaria programmes on the basis of the local malaria epidemiology (e.g. intensity of transmission, age pattern of severe disease, vector species and behaviour, and insecticide and drug resistance patterns) and contextual factors (e.g. structure and function of the health care system). The additional visits needed to administer the malaria vaccine are opportunities to provide other integrated malaria control and preventive health services. Efforts should be made to take advantage of these visits to catch up on missed vaccinations, administer vitamin A, carry out deworming, provide ITNs and other preventive interventions, and remind parents and/or caregivers of the importance of continuing to use an ITN every night, using other malaria preventive measures as recommended, and seeking prompt diagnosis and treatment for fever. Vaccine safety Both RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M vaccines are considered to be safe and well tolerated. There is a small risk of febrile seizures within seven days (mainly within 2–3 days) of vaccination[186][187]. As with any vaccine introduction, proper planning and training of staff to conduct appropriate pharmacovigilance should take place beforehand. Malaria vaccines should not be given to anyone who has experienced a severe allergic reaction after a previous hepatitis B vaccination or malaria vaccine dose or to a vaccine component[186][187].

Vaccination of special populations Malnourished children may be at particular risk of malaria infection and can be vaccinated with either vaccine. RTS,S/AS01 can be given to children with HIV infection. RTS,S/AS01 has been evaluated in infants with a history of preterm birth (before 37 weeks’ gestation) and/or low birth weight, in HIV- exposed or in HIV-infected infants and children, and in malnourished infants and children. The vaccine was found to be well tolerated and immunogenic in all groups. Antibody titres were lower in HIV-infected children than in children with an unknown or negative HIV status. A study is currently under way to assess the safety and immunogenicity of R21/Matrix-M in HIV-positive (WHO HIV stage 1 or 2 disease) children aged 5–36 months (NCT05385510)[198]. The trial of R21/Matrix-M in HIV-positive infants is ongoing and data are not yet available; therefore, there remains a possibility that the efficacy of R21/Matrix-M could be impaired in these children. The malaria vaccine should be provided to infants and young children who relocate to an area of moderate or high transmission, including during emergency situations. Countries are encouraged to consider strategies to improve coverage in populations with high need and at high risk of malaria burden and disease, including under-vaccinated children, hard-to-reach or marginalized populations, persons in areas of conflict or emergency situations, displaced populations, or those in other areas with poor access to health services. Some of these populations may benefit from delivery through campaigns. The vaccines are not recommended for use in adults (including health workers and pregnant persons). The vaccine is not indicated for travellers, who should use chemoprophylaxis and vector control methods to prevent malaria when travelling to endemic settings. Surveillance As for other vaccines, surveillance should be in place to monitor malaria vaccine safety. The prompt and rigorous investigation of any potentially linked SAEs also serves to maintain confidence in the immunization programme. Research priorities 156 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) For all WHO-recommended malaria vaccines, operational research is needed, specifically in relation to the seasonal delivery approach. The research should include annual pre-transmission season dosing after three doses given through age-based delivery, and how best to deliver the combination of SMC and seasonal malaria vaccination. Countries are encouraged to document and evaluate their experience with malaria vaccine introductions – in particular for seasonal deployment of the vaccine, expanded age range, or a five-dose schedule – to provide additional input for future updates to the guidance, including on vaccine effectiveness, feasibility and the occurrence of adverse events following immunization. Monitoring and evaluation of immunogenicity and reactogenicity of mixed vaccine use is not required but should be documented where feasible.

A number of research priorities have been identified for R21/Matrix-M. However, introduction should not be delayed pending the completion of these studies. These priority research topics include: co-administration with childhood vaccines; post-licensure studies on vaccine effectiveness in high perennial transmission settings; impact on severe malaria and mortality; monitoring of safety in infants and young children; and interchangeability studies to evaluate safety and effectiveness in children who receive different malaria vaccines in the same schedule. WHO also encourages international and national funders to support relevant learning opportunities. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Malaria vaccines, provided in a four-dose schedule, have been demonstrated in clinical trials to significantly reduce clinical malaria, providing substantial added protection to that already given by existing malaria preventive measures (i.e. ITNs and/or seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC)). In addition, pilot implementation showed that the introduction of the vaccine through routine childhood immunization programmes in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi resulted in substantial reductions in all-cause mortality, severe malaria and hospitalization with malaria. - In a large Phase 3 trial, age-based vaccination with three doses of RTS,S/AS01 resulted in significant reductions in clinical malaria (51%; 95% CI: 47–55) and severe malaria (45%; 95% CI: 22–60) during 12 months of follow-up after the third dose[179]. ◦ Over a median of 48 months of follow-up in the same Phase 3 trial, there were significant reductions in clinical malaria (39%; 95% CI: 34–43), severe malaria (29%; 95% CI: 6–46), severe malaria anaemia (61%; 95% CI: 27–81), malaria-related hospitalization (37%; 95% CI: 24–49), and the need for blood transfusion (29%; 95% CI: 4–47) among children who received a fourth dose 18 months after the third dose[179]. ◦ Overall, in the Phase 3 trial, the number of clinical malaria cases averted during the four-year follow- up period was 1774 (95% CI: 1387–2186) per 1000 children who received four vaccine doses. The largest numbers of cases averted per 1000 children vaccinated were at sites with the greatest disease burden, reaching more than 6500 cases averted per 1000 children vaccinated with four doses.[179] ◦ Vaccine efficacy was not affected by either ITN or indoor residual spraying (IRS) use during the RTS,S/AS01 Phase 3 trial[180]. - During seven years of follow-up in a subset of children from three of the 11 Phase 3 trial sites, there were significant reductions in clinical malaria in children who received four doses (24%; 95% CI: 16–31) or three doses (19%; 95% CI: 11–27). Therefore, children who received three or four doses of RTS,S/ AS01 benefited for at least seven years after vaccination and did not have an excess risk of clinical or severe malaria.[181]", "page_start": 157, "page_end": 157, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Therefore, children who received three or four doses of RTS,S/ AS01 benefited for at least seven years after vaccination and did not have an excess risk of clinical or severe malaria.[181] - The R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine has also demonstrated efficacy in a multi-centre Phase 3 trial; when given through an age-based approach, there was a significant reduction in clinical malaria (66%; 95% CI: 56–73) during 12 months of follow-up after the third dose[182]. - High public health impact was also demonstrated through the pilot implementation of RTS,S/AS01. Over 46 months of vaccine introduction via routine immunization systems in parts of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, there were significant vaccine-attributable reductions in all-cause mortality (excluding injury) (13%; 95% CI: 3–22), hospitalization with severe malaria (22%; 95% CI: 3–36) and hospitalization with malarial parasitaemia or antigenaemia (17%; 95% CI: 5–27) among children who were age-eligible for vaccination (Milligan P and Fogelson A,unpublished evidence). - Providing malaria vaccines through a seasonal approach has been shown to increase vaccine efficacy. 157 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) ◦ Among children who received a combination of RTS,S/AS01 seasonal vaccination and SMC, there was a substantially greater reduction in clinical malaria (72%; 95% CI: 64–78), compared to SMC alone, during 12 months of follow-up after the third dose. Results were similar after three years of follow-up, with significant reductions in clinical malaria (63%; 95% CI: 58–67), hospital admissions with severe malaria (71%; 95% CI: 42–85) and deaths from malaria (73%; 95% CI: 3–92), compared to SMC alone. Seasonal vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 before the peak transmission season was non-inferior to SMC in preventing clinical malaria (hazard ratio: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.84–1.01)[183]. ◦ Similarly, when R21/Matrix-M was given through a seasonal approach together with SMC (provided as standard of care by the government), there was a significant reduction in clinical malaria (75%; 95% CI: 71–78) during 12 months of follow-up after the third dose[182]. ◦ The efficacy measured for the two vaccines was in addition to the existing interventions being provided (high ITN coverage, provided as part of the trial, and SMC, provided as part of the trial or administered by the ministry of health). - Modelling estimates that approximately 450 deaths can be averted per 100 000 children vaccinated with an age-based four-dose schedule of RTS,S/AS01 in areas of moderate to high transmission.

Certainty of the High evidence The overall rating of the evidence on malaria vaccines is HIGH.The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to high. Certainty of the evidence related to the effectiveness of RTS,S/AS01based on critical outcomes was mostly rated HIGH in the large-scale Phase 3 clinical trial and MODERATE (due to wide CIs) in the pilot implementation study.

Certainty of the evidence on the safety outcomes of meningitis, cerebral malaria and gender-specific mortality is now graded MODERATE, reflecting the wide CIs related to relatively rare events. Multiple WHO advisory committees reviewed the data from the pilot implementation study and concluded that there was no evidence that the Phase 3 safety signals were causally related to RTS,S/AS01 vaccination, supporting the conclusion that they were chance findings[188]. In addition, these safety signals were not seen in the Phase 2 trials[189]or subsequent Phase 3 trials[181][183]. Certainty of the evidence related to the efficacy of R21/Matrix-Mranged from MODERATE to HIGH based on vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria as a critical outcome, with minor downgrading due to the lack of data on age-based vaccine administration in high perennial transmission settings. However, given the similarity of the R21/Matrix-M vaccine to the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine and the demonstration of RTS,S/AS01 efficacy in areas of high, medium and low malaria transmission, as well as in highly seasonal malaria settings, it is reasonable to assume that R21/Matrix-M will be efficacious in all malaria-endemic settings. Nonetheless, it will be important to collect post-licensure data on the public health impact of R21/Matrix-M in settings of high perennial transmission and low transmission. Certainty of the evidence related to the safety of R21/Matrix-Mranged from LOW to MODERATE due to few or no events, wide CIs and small sample size. While the vaccine was associated with febrile seizures at a rate of approximately one per 2500 vaccinations, all febrile seizures resolved without sequelae. There was no imbalance in other severe adverse events (SAEs) among children vaccinated with R21/Matrix-M or with the control (rabies) vaccine in the Phase 3 trial. There was no excess of the adverse events of special interest (cerebral malaria, meningitis) in the R21/Matrix-M arm. Notably, the MVIP was designed to identify an excess of these outcomes or causal association with RTS,S/AS01; results after 46 months of vaccine introduction indicated no causal association between these outcomes and RTS,S/AS01 vaccination (Milligan P and Fogelson A,unpublished evidence). As a result, cerebral malaria, meningitis and differential impact on mortality by gender are not included as critical outcomes for a WHO recommendation for R21/Matrix-M. Further data should be collected on the safety of the vaccine (which includes the Matrix-M adjuvant) in the target age group, which can be monitored post-licensure.

Values and No substantial variability expected preferences Malaria remains a primary cause of childhood illness and mortality in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Preferences and values of the target population have been assessed in several ways: - Qualitative interviews with caregivers and health providers revealed the perceived value of malaria vaccines in reducing the severity and frequency of malaria. Positive attitudes and trust among caregivers increased substantially over time, driven mainly by their perception of the malaria vaccine’s health benefits in their own children and in the broader community. - Malaria vaccine coverage from cross-sectional household surveys and from routine facility-based administrative data indicated that the vaccine was acceptable to the target population with relatively rapid scale-up for a new vaccine with a unique schedule and drop-out between doses comparable to other vaccines (see “Feasibility” section). - In terms of coverage of other interventions, household surveys and routine administrative data from areas where the malaria vaccine was introduced indicated that the vaccine had no negative effects on the uptake of other childhood vaccinations, ITN use, or health-seeking behaviour for febrile illness. - The high demand for the malaria vaccine among countries in Africa that have expressed interest and/or are planning vaccine introduction indicates the relative importance of the desirable outcomes of this intervention for the target population (children and their caregivers). 159 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) More information can be found in theFull evidence report on the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine(unpublished evidence) sections 5.3.4.2 and 6.3.1 (Routine data, methods and results), sections 5.3.4.3 and 6.3.2 (Household survey methods and results), and sections 5.3.4.5 and 6.3.4 (Qualitative health utilization study methods and results,unpublished evidence).

Overall, the models estimated that ICERs were only marginally lower for the seasonal vaccination strategies (i.e. more cost-effective), despite the higher number of overall doses delivered. At an assumed R21/Matrix-M vaccine price of US$ 3 per dose andPfPR2-10of 3–65%, one malaria model predicted median ICERs of US$ 7 (95% CI: 4–48) per clinical case averted and US$ 34 (95% CI: 29–139) per DALY averted in perennial settings for a four-dose age-based schedule of R21/Matrix-M, compared to no malaria vaccine[184]. The predicted ICERs for an age-based schedule in seasonal settings were US$ 6 (95% CI: 3–63) per clinical case averted and US$ 30 (95% CI: 22–172) per DALY averted. Estimates were similar for a four-dose seasonal schedule, with median ICERs of US$ 9 (5–78) per clinical case averted and US$ 48 (95% CI: 45–221) per DALY averted. In seasonal settings, cost-effectiveness was similar using age- based, seasonal or hybrid vaccination schedules. For both vaccines, public health impact and cost-effectiveness tended to be greater at higher levels of transmission across all implementation and dose regimens. Caution is required when comparing cost-effectiveness estimates for different interventions evaluated with different methods, outcome measures, time intervals and contexts (e.g. with different concurrent health interventions and standards of care).

In Kenya, there was also lower coverage of the fourth dose in the lowest socioeconomic status tertile. Vaccine coverage was higher among children sleeping under an ITN in Kenya (for the first three doses) and in Ghana (for the fourth dose). - Vaccine introduction extended the reach of malaria prevention tools; across the three pilot countries, more than two thirds of the children who reportedly did not sleep under an ITN received at least their first dose of the malaria vaccine, increasing the proportion of children with access to one or more malaria prevention tools (ITNs or RTS,S/AS01) to over 90%. In Ghana, the proportion of children with access to at last one malaria prevention tool (ITNs or RTS,S/AS01) increased from 61% to 94%, and, in Kenya, from 78% to 95%.

Acceptability Malaria vaccines are considered acceptable to the following groups: - Target population (including eligible children and their caregivers): This is based on administrative data and household surveys during the pilot introduction of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, which indicate good uptake and coverage and modest drop-out rates. Continued increases in uptake suggest that the additional visits needed to receive the vaccine are acceptable to the target population. Qualitative data indicate high acceptance and desirability of the vaccine. - Key stakeholders (including ministries of health and immunization programme managers): This is based on post-introduction evaluations, the good uptake and coverage of the malaria vaccine, and qualitative study interviews with health providers during the pilot introduction of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine. Chief concerns from health providers were around the operational challenges faced in introducing and delivering RTS,S/AS01 (i.e. increased workload, training, eligibility). Household surveys found no impact on the use of ITNs in intervention areas following the introduction of RTS,S/AS01, indicating that both interventions are acceptable and the vaccine has not displaced ITN use.

Administrative data from early implementing areas through 46 months of RTS,S/AS01 vaccinations under the pilot programme showed the following: - About 4.2 million RTS,S/AS01 vaccine doses were administered across the three pilot countries and more than 1.2 million children received their first dose. - All three countries reached more than 80% of their target populations with the first RTS,S/AS01 dose, at least 69% with the third dose and at least 40% with the fourth dose (Milligan P and Fogelson A, unpublished evidence). The R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine is anticipated to have the same level of feasibility, due to having the same indication for use, target population, dose schedule and route of administration, and similar product formulation and storage requirements. More information on the evidence can be found in theFull evidence report on the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine(unpublished evidence) sections 5.3.4.2 and 6.3.1 (routine data, methods and results).

Justification High public health impact has been demonstrated through the introduction of the malaria vaccine via routine childhood immunization programmes. As part of large-scale WHO-coordinated pilot implementation in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, the introduction of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine resulted in substantial reductions in all-cause mortality (excluding injury) (13%; 95% CI: 3–22) and hospitalization with severe malaria (22%; 95% CI: 3–36). Considering the high burden of malaria, the high uptake and coverage of vaccines, and the level of impact on deaths and severe malaria observed during the pilot implementation of RTS,S/AS01, malaria vaccine introduction can have a significant public health impact, whether delivered in areas of seasonal or perennial transmission.

R21/Matrix-M is anticipated to have an impact similar to that of RTS,S/AS01, given the similarities between the two vaccines with respect to vaccine construct, target population, vaccination schedule and delivery strategies. The pilot implementation also demonstrated that the introduction of RTS,S/AS01 had no unintended consequences, meaning that increased access to malaria vaccines had no negative effect on the uptake of other childhood vaccinations, ITN use or health-seeking behaviour for febrile illness. In clinical trials, RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M have both been shown to significantly reduce clinical malaria, demonstrating substantial added protection to that already provided by existing malaria control measures, including ITNs, SMC, and prompt access to diagnosis and treatment. The malaria vaccines have acceptable safety profiles and are well tolerated. There is a small risk of febrile seizures within seven days (mainly within 2–3 days) of vaccination. As with any vaccine, proper planning and training of staff to conduct pharmacovigilance should be in place prior to vaccine introduction. Research needs For all WHO-recommended malaria vaccines, operational research is needed, specifically in relation to the seasonal delivery approach. The research should include annual pre-transmission season dosing after three doses given through age-based delivery, and how best to deliver the combination of SMC and seasonal malaria vaccination. Countries are encouraged to document and evaluate their experience with malaria vaccine introductions – in particular for seasonal deployment of the vaccine, expanded age range, or a five-dose schedule – to provide additional input for future updates to the guidance, including on vaccine effectiveness, feasibility and the occurrence of adverse events following immunization. Monitoring and evaluation of immunogenicity and reactogenicity of mixed vaccine use is not required but should be documented where feasible. A number of research priorities have been identified for R21/Matrix-M. However, introduction should not be delayed pending the completion of these studies. These priority research topics include: co-administration with childhood vaccines; post-licensure studies on vaccine effectiveness in high perennial transmission settings; impact on severe malaria and mortality; monitoring of safety in infants and young children; and interchangeability studies to evaluate safety and effectiveness in children who receive different malaria vaccines in the same schedule. 162 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) WHO also encourages international and national funders to support relevant learning opportunities. 5.

Case management Background Malaria case management, consisting of early diagnosis and prompt effective treatment, remains a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies. The WHO Guidelines for the treatment of malaria were first developed in 2006 and have been revised periodically, with the most recent edition published in 2015. WHO guidelines contain recommendations on clinical practice or public health policy intended to guide end-users as to the individual or collective actions that can or should be taken in specific situations to achieve the best possible health outcomes. Such recommendations are also designed to help the user to select and prioritize interventions from a range of potential alternatives. The third edition of the WHO Guidelines for the treatment of malaria consolidated here contains updated recommendations based on new evidence particularly related to dosing in children, and also includes recommendations on the use of drugs to prevent malaria in groups at high risk. Since publication of the first edition of theGuidelines for the treatment of malariain 2006 and the second edition in 2010, all countries in whichP. falciparummalaria is endemic have progressively updated their treatment policy from use of monotherapy with drugs such as chloroquine, amodiaquine and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine (SP) to the currently recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT). The ACTs are generally highly effective and well tolerated. This has contributed substantially to reductions in global morbidity and mortality from malaria. Unfortunately, resistance to artemisinins has arisen recently inP. falciparumin South-East Asia, which threatens these gains. Core principles The following core principles were used by the Guidelines Development Group that drew up theGuidelines for the Treatment of Malaria. 1.Early diagnosis and prompt, effective treatment of malaria Uncomplicated falciparum malaria can progress rapidly to severe forms of the disease, especially in people with no or low immunity, and severe falciparum malaria is almost always fatal without treatment. Therefore, programmes should ensure access to early diagnosis and prompt, effective treatment within 24–48 h of the onset of malaria symptoms. 2. Rational use of antimalarial agents To reduce the spread of drug resistance, limit unnecessary use of antimalarial drugs and better identify other febrile illnesses in the context of changing malaria epidemiology, antimalarial medicines should be administered only to patients who truly have malaria. Adherence to a full treatment course must be promoted. Universal access to parasitological diagnosis of malaria is now possible with the use of quality-assured rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which are also appropriate for use in primary health care and community settings. 3. Combination therapy Preventing or delaying resistance is essential for the success of both national and global strategies for control and eventual elimination of malaria. To help protect current and future antimalarial medicines, all episodes of malaria should be treated with at least two effective antimalarial medicines with different mechanisms of action (combination", "page_start": 163, "page_end": 163, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

To help protect current and future antimalarial medicines, all episodes of malaria should be treated with at least two effective antimalarial medicines with different mechanisms of action (combination therapy). 4.Appropriate weight-based dosing To prolong their useful therapeutic life and ensure that all patients have an equal chance of being cured, the quality of antimalarial drugs must be ensured, and antimalarial drugs must be given at optimal dosages. Treatment should maximize the likelihood of rapid clinical and parasitological cure and minimize transmission from the treated infection. To achieve this, dosage regimens should be based on the patient’s weight and should provide effective concentrations of antimalarial drugs for a sufficient time to eliminate the infection in all target populations. Please refer toMalaria case management: operations manual[197]. 5.1 Diagnosing malaria Suspected malaria The signs and symptoms of malaria are non-specific. Malaria is suspected clinically primarily on the basis of fever or a history of fever. There is no combination of signs or symptoms that reliably distinguishes malaria from other causes of fever; diagnosis based only on clinical features has very low specificity and results in overtreatment. Other possible causes of fever and whether alternative or additional treatment is required must always be carefully considered. The focus of malaria diagnosis should be to identify patients who truly have malaria, to guide rational use of antimalarial medicines. 163 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) In malaria-endemic areas, malaria should be suspected in any patient presenting with a history of fever or temperature ≥ 37.5 °C and no other obvious cause. In areas in which malaria transmission is stable (or during the high-transmission period of seasonal malaria), malaria should also be suspected in children with palmar pallor or a haemoglobin concentration of < 8 g/dL. High-transmission settings include many parts of sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of Oceania. In settings where the incidence of malaria is very low, parasitological diagnosis of all cases of fever may result in considerable expenditure to detect only a few patients with malaria. In these settings, health workers should be trained to identify patients who may have been exposed to malaria (e.g. recent travel to a malaria-endemic area without protective measures) and have fever or a history of fever with no other obvious cause, before they conduct a parasitological test. In all settings, suspected malaria should be confirmed with a parasitological test.The results of parasitological diagnosis should be available within a short time (< 2 h) of the patient presenting. In settings where parasitological diagnosis is not possible, a decision to provide antimalarial treatment must be based on the probability that the illness is malaria.

In all settings, suspected malaria should be confirmed with a parasitological test.The results of parasitological diagnosis should be available within a short time (< 2 h) of the patient presenting. In settings where parasitological diagnosis is not possible, a decision to provide antimalarial treatment must be based on the probability that the illness is malaria. In children < 5 years, the practical algorithms for management of the sick child provided by the WHO–United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) strategy for Integrated Management of Childhood Illness[198]should be used to ensure full assessment and appropriate case management at first-level health facilities and at the community level. Parasitological diagnosis The benefit of parasitological diagnosis relies entirely on an appropriate management response of health care providers. The two methods used routinely for parasitological diagnosis of malaria are light microscopy and immunochromatographic RDTs. The latter detect parasite-specific antigens or enzymes that are either genus or species specific. Both microscopy and RDTs must be supported by a quality assurance programme. Antimalarial treatment should be limited to cases with positive tests, and patients with negative results should be reassessed for other common causes of fever and treated appropriately. In nearly all cases of symptomatic malaria, examination of thick and thin blood films by a competent microscopist will reveal malaria parasites. Malaria RDTs should be used if quality-assured malaria microscopy is not readily available. RDTs for detecting PfHRP2 can be useful for patients who have received incomplete antimalarial treatment, in whom blood films can be negative. This is particularly likely if the patient received a recent dose of an artemisinin derivative. If the initial blood film examination is negative in patients with manifestations compatible with severe malaria, a series of blood films should be examined at 6–12 h intervals, or an RDT (preferably one detecting PfHRP2) should be performed. If both the slide examination and the RDT results are negative, malaria is extremely unlikely, and other causes of the illness should be sought and treated. This document does not include recommendations for use of specific RDTs or for interpreting test results. For guidance, see the WHO manualUniversal access to malaria diagnostic testing[199]. Diagnosis of malaria In patients with suspected severe malaria and in other high-risk groups, such as patients living with HIV/AIDS, absence or delay of parasitological diagnosis should not delay an immediate start of antimalarial treatment. At present, molecular diagnostic tools based on nucleic-acid amplification techniques (e.g. loop-mediated isothermal amplification or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) do not have a role in the clinical management of malaria. WhereP. vivaxmalaria is common and microscopy is not available, it is recommended that a combination RDT be used that allows detection of P. vivax (pLDH antigen fromP. vivax) or pan-malarial antigens (Pan-pLDH or aldolase).

Light microscopy Microscopy not only provides a highly sensitive, specific diagnosis of malaria when performed well but also allows quantification of malaria parasites and identification of the infecting species. Light microscopy involves relatively high costs for training and supervision, and the accuracy of diagnosis is strongly dependent on the competence of the microscopist. Microscopy technicians may also contribute to the diagnosis of non-malarial diseases. Although nucleic acid amplification-based tests are more sensitive, light microscopy is still considered the “field standard” against which the sensitivity and specificity of other methods must be assessed. A skilled microscopist can detect asexual parasites at a density of < 10 per μL of blood, but under typical field conditions, the limit of sensitivity is approximately 100 parasites per μL[200]. This limit of detection approximates the lower end of the pyrogenic density range. Thus, microscopy provides good specificity for diagnosing malaria as the cause of a presenting febrile illness. More sensitive methods allow detection of an increasing proportion of cases of incidental parasitaemia in endemic areas, thus reducing the specificity of a positive test. Light microscopy has other important advantages: - low direct costs, if laboratory infrastructure to maintain the service is available; 164 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - high sensitivity, if the performance of microscopy is high; - differentiation of Plasmodia species; - determination of parasite densities – notably identification of hyperparasitaemia; - detection of gametocytaemia; - allows monitoring of responses to therapy and - can be used to diagnose many other conditions. Good performance of microscopy can be difficult to maintain, because of the requirements for adequate training and supervision of laboratory staff to ensure competence in malaria diagnosis, electricity, good quality slides and stains, provision and maintenance of good microscopes and maintenance of quality assurance[201]and control of laboratory services. Numerous attempts have been made to improve malaria microscopy, but none has proven to be superior to the classical method of Giemsa staining and oil-immersion microscopy for performance in typical health care settings[202]. Rapid diagnostic tests Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are immuno-chromatographic tests for detecting parasite-specific antigens in a finger-prick blood sample. Some tests allow detection of only one species (P. falciparum); others allow detection of one or more of the other species of human malaria parasites (P. vivax,P. malariaeandP. ovale)[203][204][205]. They are available commercially in various formats, e.g. dipsticks, cassettes and cards. Cassettes and cards are easier to use in difficult conditions outside health facilities. RDTs are relatively simple to perform and to interpret, and they do not require electricity or special equipment[206].

RDTs are relatively simple to perform and to interpret, and they do not require electricity or special equipment[206]. Since 2012, WHO has recommended that RDTs should be selected in accordance with the following criteria, based on the results of the assessments of theWHO Malaria RDT Product Testing programme[207]: - For detection ofP. falciparumin all transmission settings, the panel detection score againstP. falciparumsamples should be at least 75% at 200 parasites/μL. - For detection ofP. vivaxin all transmission settings the panel detection score againstP. vivaxsamples should be at least 75% at 200 parasites/μL. - The false positive rate should be less than 10%. - The invalid rate should be less than 5%. Current tests are based on the detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), which is specific forP. falciparum, pan-specific or species- specificPlasmodiumlactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) or pan-specific aldolase. The different characteristics of these antigens may affect their suitability for use in different situations, and these should be taken into account in programmes for RDT implementation. The tests have many potential advantages, including: - rapid provision of results and extension of diagnostic services to the lowest-level health facilities and communities; - fewer requirements for training and skilled personnel (for instance, a general health worker can be trained in 1 day); and - reinforcement of patient confidence in the diagnosis and in the health service in general. They also have potential disadvantages, including: - inability, in the case ofPfHRP2-based RDTs, to distinguish new infections from recently and effectively treated infections, due to the persistence ofPfHRP2 in the blood for 1–5 weeks after effective treatment; - the presence in countries in the Amazon region of variable frequencies of HRP2 deletions inP. falciparumparasites, making HRP2-based tests not suitable in this region[208]; - poor sensitivity for detectingP. malariaeandP. ovale; and - the heterogeneous quality of commercially available products and the existence of lot-to-lot variation. In a systematic review[209], the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs in detectingP. falciparumin blood samples from patients in endemic areas attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria were compared with the sensitivity and specificity of microscopy or polymerase chain reaction. The average sensitivity ofPfHRP2-detecting RDTs was 95.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.5–96.2%), and the specificity was 95.2% (93.4–99.4%). RDTs for detectingpLDH fromP. falciparumare generally less sensitive and more specific than those for detecting HRP2, with an average sensitivity (95% CI) of 93.2% (88.0–96.2%) and a specificity of 98.5% (96.7–99.4%). Several studies have shown that health workers, volunteers and private sector providers can, with adequate training and supervision, use RDTs correctly and provide accurate malaria diagnoses.

The criteria for selecting and procuring RDTs can be found on theWHO website. 165 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Diagnosis with either microscopy or RDTs is expected to reduce overuse of antimalarial medicines by ensuring that treatment is given only to patients with confirmed malaria infection, as opposed to treating all patients with fever[210]. Although providers of care may be willing to perform diagnostic tests, they do not, however, always respond appropriately to the results. This is especially true when they are negative. It is therefore important to ensure the accuracy of parasite- based diagnosis and also to demonstrate this to users and to provide them with the resources to manage both positive and negative results adequately[199]. Immunodiagnosis and nucleic acid amplification test methods Detection of antibodies to parasites, which may be useful for epidemiological studies, is neither sensitive nor specific enough to be of use in the management of patients suspected of having malaria[211]. Techniques to detect parasite nucleic acid, e.g. polymerase chain reaction and loop-mediated isothermal amplification, are highly sensitive and very useful for detecting mixed infections, in particular at low parasite densities that are not detectable by conventional microscopy or with RDTs. They are also useful for studies of drug resistance and other specialized epidemiological investigations[212]; however, they are not generally available for large-scale field use in malaria- endemic areas, nor are they appropriate for routine diagnosis in endemic areas where a large proportion of the population may have low-density parasitaemia. These techniques may be useful for population surveys and focus investigation in malaria elimination programmes. At present, nucleic acid-based amplification techniques have no role in the clinical management of malaria or in routine surveillance systems[213]. Practice Statement Diagnosing malaria (2015) All cases of suspected malaria should have a parasitological test (microscopy or RDT) to confirm the diagnosis. Both microscopy and RDTs should be supported by a quality assurance programme. Justification Prompt, accurate diagnosis of malaria is part of effective disease management. All patients with suspected malaria should be treated on the basis of a confirmed diagnosis by microscopy examination or RDT testing of a blood sample. Correct diagnosis in malaria-endemic areas is particularly important for the most vulnerable population groups, such as young children and non-immune populations, in whom falciparum malaria can be rapidly fatal. High specificity will reduce unnecessary treatment with antimalarial drugs and improve the diagnosis of other febrile illnesses in all settings. WHO strongly advocates a policy of “test, treat and track” to improve the quality of care and surveillance. 5.2 Treating malaria 5.2.1 Treating uncomplicated malaria Definition of uncomplicated malaria A patient who presents with symptoms of malaria and a positive parasitological", "page_start": 166, "page_end": 166, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Therapeutic objectives The clinical objectives of treating uncomplicated malaria are to cure the infection as rapidly as possible and to prevent progression to severe disease. “Cure” is defined as elimination of all parasites from the body. The public health objectives of treatment are to prevent onward transmission of the infection to others and to prevent the emergence and spread of resistance to antimalarial drugs. 166 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Incorrect approaches to treatment Use of monotherapy The continued use of artemisinins or any of the partner medicines alone will compromise the value of ACT by selecting for drug resistance. As certain patient groups, such as pregnant women, may need specifically tailored combination regimens, single artemisinin derivatives will still be used in selected referral facilities in the public sector, but they should be withdrawn entirely from the private and informal sectors and from peripheral public health care facilities. Similarly, continued availability of amodiaquine, mefloquine and SP as monotherapies in many countries is expected to shorten their useful therapeutic life as partner drugs of ACT, and they should be withdrawn wherever possible. Incompletedosing In endemic regions, some semi-immune malaria patients are cured by an incomplete course of antimalarial drugs or by a treatment regimen that would be ineffective in patients with no immunity. In the past, this led to different recommendations for patients considered semi-immune and those considered non-immune. As individual immunity can vary considerably, even in areas of moderate-to-high transmission intensity, this practice is no longer recommended. A full treatment course with a highly effective ACT is required whether or not the patient is considered to be semi-immune. Another potentially dangerous practice is to give only the first dose of a treatment course to patients with suspected but unconfirmed malaria, with the intention of giving the full treatment if the diagnosis is confirmed. This practice is unsafe, could engender resistance, and is not recommended. Additional considerations for clinical management Can the patient take oral medication?

Although such patients do not show other signs of severity, they should receive the same initial antimalarial treatments recommended for severe malaria. Initial rectal or parenteral treatment must always be followed by a full 3-day course of ACT. Use of antipyretics In young children, high fevers are often associated with vomiting, regurgitation of medication and seizures. They are thus treated with antipyretics and, if necessary, fanning and tepid sponging. Antipyretics should be used if the core temperature is > 38.5 oC. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) at a dose of 15 mg/kg bw every 4 h is widely used; it is safe and well tolerated and can be given orally or as a suppository. Ibuprofen (5 mg/kg bw) has been used successfully as an alternative in the treatment of malaria and other childhood fevers, but, like aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, it isno longer recommendedbecause of the risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment and Reye’s syndrome. Use of anti-emetics Vomiting is common in acute malaria and may be severe. Parenteral antimalarial treatment may therefore be required until oral administration is tolerated. Then a full 3-day course of ACT should be given. Anti-emetics are potentially sedative and may have neuropsychiatric adverse effects, which could mask or confound the diagnosis of severe malaria. They should therefore be used with caution. Management of seizures Generalized seizures are more common in children withP. falciparummalaria than in those with malaria due to other species. This suggests an overlap between the cerebral pathology resulting from falciparum malaria and febrile convulsions. As seizures may be a prodrome of cerebral malaria, patients who have more than two seizures within a 24 h period should be treated as for severe malaria. If the seizures continue, the airways should be maintained and anticonvulsants given (parenteral or rectal benzodiazepines or intramuscular paraldehyde). When the seizure has stopped, the child should be treated as indicated in section 7.10.5,if his or her core temperature is > 38.5 oC. There is no evidence that prophylactic anticonvulsants are beneficial in otherwise uncomplicated malaria, and they are not recommended. 5.2.1.1 Artemisinin-based combination therapy 167 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Strong recommendation for , High certainty evidence Artemisinin-based combination therapy (2015) Children and adults with uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria should be treated with one of the following ACTs*: - artemether-lumefantrine (AL) - artesunate-amodiaquine (AS+AQ) - artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) - dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAP) - artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) - artesunate-pyronaridine (ASPY) (2022) *Artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate-pyronaridine are not recommended for use in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Practical info The pipeline for new antimalarial drugs is healthier than ever before, and several new compounds are in various stages of development. Some novel antimalarial agents are already registered in some countries. The decision to recommend antimalarial drugs for general use depends on the strength of the evidence for safety and efficacy and the context of use. In general, when there are no satisfactory alternatives, newly registered drugs may be recommended; however, for global or unrestricted recommendations, considerably more evidence than that submitted for registration is usually required, to provide sufficient confidence for their safety, efficacy and relative merits as compared with currently recommended treatments. Several new antimalarial drugs or new combinations have been introduced recently. Some are still in the pre-registration phase and are not discussed here. Arterolane + piperaquine, artemisinin + piperaquine base and artemisinin + napththoquine are new ACTs, which are registered and used in some countries. In addition, there are several new generic formulations of existing drugs. None of these yet has a sufficient evidence base for general recommendation (i.e. unrestricted use). Arterolane + piperaquineis a combination of a synthetic ozonide and piperaquine phosphate that is registered in India. There are currently insufficient data to make general recommendations. Artemisinin + piperaquine basecombines two well-established, well-tolerated compounds. It differs from previous treatments in that the piperaquine is in the base form, the artemisinin dose is relatively low, and the current recommendation is for only a 2-day regimen. There are insufficient data from clinical trials for a general recommendation, and there is concern that the artemisinin dose regimen provides insufficient protection against resistance to the piperaquine component. Artemisinin + naphthoquineis also a combination of two relatively old compounds that is currently being promoted as a single-dose regimen, contrary to WHO advice for 3 days of the artemisinin derivative. There are currently insufficient data from rigorously conducted randomized controlled trials to make general recommendations. Many ACTs are generics. The bioavailability of generics of currently recommended drugs must be comparable to that of the established, originally registered product, and the satisfactory pharmaceutical quality of the product must be maintained.

Desirable effects: - A PCR-adjusted treatment failure rate of < 5% has been seen consistently in trials of dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine (high-quality evidence). - Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine has a longer half-life than artemether + lumefantrine, and fewer new infections occur within 9 weeks of treatment with dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine (high- quality evidence). - Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine and artesunate + mefloquine have similar half-lives, and a similar frequency of new infections is seen within 9 weeks of treatment (moderate-quality evidence).

Certainty of the High evidence For all critical outcomes:High. Justification GRADE In the absence of resistance to the partner drug, the five recommended ACTs have all been shown to achieve a PCR- adjusted treatment failure rate of 5% in many trials in several settings in both adults and children (high-quality evidence)[215][216]. Other considerations The guideline development group decided to recommend a menu of approved combinations, from which countries can select first- and second-line treatment. Remarks Recommendation:Treat adults and children with uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria (including infants, pregnant women in their second and third trimesters and breastfeeding women) with ACT. The WHO-approved first-line ACT options are: artemether + lumefantrine, artesunate + amodiaquine, artesunate + mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine and artesunate + sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine. These options are recommended for adults and children, including infants, lactating women and pregnant women in their second and third trimester. In deciding which ACTs to adopt in national treatment policies, national policy- makers should take into account: the pattern of resistance to antimalarial drugs in the country, the relative efficacy and safety of the combinations, their cost, the availability of paediatric formulations and the availability of co-formulated products. Fixed-dose combinations are preferred to loose tablets or co-blistered products. 169 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) The Guideline Development Group decided to recommend a “menu” of approved combinations from which countries can select first- and second- line therapies.

Modelling studies suggest that having multiple first-line ACTs available for use may help to prevent or delay the development of resistance. Recommendation:Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine is recommended for general use. A systematic review showed that the dosing regimen of dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine currently recommended by the manufacturers leads to sub-optimal dosing in young children. The group plans to recommend a revised dosing regimen based on models of pharmacokinetics. Further studies of the risk for QT interval prolongation have been requested by the European Medicines Agency. ACT is a combination of a rapidly acting artemisinin derivative with a longer-acting (more slowly eliminated) partner drug. The artemisinin component rapidly clears parasites from the blood (reducing parasite numbers by a factor of approximately 10 000 in each 48 h asexual cycle) and is also active against the sexual stages of the gametocytes that mediate onward transmission to mosquitos. The longer- acting partner drug clears the remaining parasites and provides protection against development of resistance to the artemisinin derivative. Partner drugs with longer elimination half-lives also provide a period of post-treatment prophylaxis. The GDG recommended dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine for use in 2009 but re-evaluated the evidence in 2013 because additional data on its safety had become available.The group noted the small absolute prolongation of the QT interval with dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine but was satisfied that the increase was of comparable magnitude to that observed with chloroquine and was not important clinically[214][217]. Strong recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Artesunate-pyronaridine for uncomplicated malaria (2022) Artesunate-pyronaridine (ASPY) is recommended as an artemisinin-based combination therapy option for the treatment of uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria. - ASPY should be avoided by individuals with known liver disease (clinically apparent liver disease) because ASPY is associated with liver transaminitis. - Pharmacovigilance should be strengthened where ASPY is used for the treatment of malaria. Practical info As with the deployment of any new malaria treatment, pharmacovigilance and resistance surveillance systems should be strengthened. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms - ASPY, with large treatment effects, has been shown to be non-inferior in efficacycompared to the currently recommended ACTs. The overall benefit of this additional ACT is its potential to provide an alternative treatment, thereby reducing pressure on the partner medicines in the face of emerging artemisinin partner drug resistance. - Compared to other ACTs, ASPY may have fewer PCR-adjusted and PCR-unadjusted failures at day 28, while results for day 42 are inconclusive. Data for children are limited. - Following careful safety reviews, the conclusions are that the use of ASPY can be accompanied by mild, reversible and asymptomatic elevations of some liver enzymes, but that these elevations are not associated with clinically detected hepatotoxicity.

Data for children are limited. - Following careful safety reviews, the conclusions are that the use of ASPY can be accompanied by mild, reversible and asymptomatic elevations of some liver enzymes, but that these elevations are not associated with clinically detected hepatotoxicity. ASPY is more likely than artemether- lumefantrine or artesunate-mefloquine to increase aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >5 times, but the risks are similar to those of artesunate-amodiaquine; there is no clear association of ASPY with increased bilirubin. There is no evidence to date to suggest that these transiently elevated transaminases result in serious liver injury. - The risk of vomiting appears to be significantly higher in young children (7.7%) and infants (11.2%) than in older children (3.1%) and adults (2.8%)[218]. However, the overall risk of vomiting with ASPY is similar to the risks with other ACTs (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.71–1.17; nine studies; n=5534)[219]. 170 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - There are no data available from patients with pre-existing liver conditions (e.g. hepatitis B or C) or from those with risk factors for liver disease (e.g. receiving medicines known to be hepatotoxic, use of potentially hepatotoxic herbal medicines, alcohol abuse). There is, however, some early reassuring data from a study[218]that included limited data on inadvertent exposures of patients with HIV (15 exposures) and 158 persons with elevated liver enzymes (AST or ALT >2 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) at baseline. Caution is advised in these patients when considering ASPY as treatment, as these risk factors, as well as coadministration of potential hepatotoxic medicines (including paracetamol commonly used in patients with malaria), might have a cumulative adverse effect on the liver. Certainty of the Low evidence The GDG judged the overall certainty of the assessed evidence to be low mostly due to imprecision and indirectness. Values and The GDG determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in individual preferences patients’ values and preferences, but country-level value judgements are still important, as these could be influenced by the prevalence of antimalarial partner drug resistance and the prevalence of hepatic diseases. Resources Research evidence Research on formal cost analysis, and cost estimates related to scale are required. However, changing first- or second-line malaria treatment is quite resource-intensive, requiring staff training and patient information and introducing supply chain and logistical issues. However, introducing ASPY is not expected to be different from other ACTs already in use, as any additional cost would be minimal based on the actual cost of the medicine.

However, introducing ASPY is not expected to be different from other ACTs already in use, as any additional cost would be minimal based on the actual cost of the medicine. Equity The GDG considered that ASPY is likely to enhance equity, especially in areas of emerging resistance to existing combinations. The addition of ASPY as a treatment option for malaria will probably increase health equity. Acceptability Although in some countries there is limited experience of its use, ASPY is probably acceptable given that some countries already include ASPY in therapeutic efficacy studies. Aside from the additional resource implications with the introduction of a new antimalarial regimen, oral treatments are generally well accepted. Some issues might arise when hepatic risk profiles need to be assessed in the target population. Feasibility Policy changes are feasible, since some countries have already started to use ASPY. The medicine is available, and the treatment regimen is similar to that of other approved ACTs. ASPY has also received a positive scientific opinion from the European Medicines Agency under Article 58 and is thus included in the WHO list of prequalified antimalarial medicines. However, the feasibility of strengthening pharmacovigilance will be highly variable from country to country. 171 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Justification The GDG reached a consensus on a strong recommendation for the intervention, despite the low certainty of evidence because of: - the large magnitude of treatment effect, as well as its non-inferiority and comparability to the other currently recommended ACTs; - its tolerability and generally mild, reversible adverse events; and - the probable increased equity from access to an additional treatment option, specifically in the face of increasing ACT partner drug resistance. Research needs The GDG highlighted the following evidence gaps requiring further research. These relate to: - individual patient data meta-analysis comparing hepatic safety and gastrointestinal tolerability (particularly vomiting in young children and infants within one hour of dosing, as this could alter efficacy) between ASPY and other ACTs; - continued assessment of efficacy, safety and tolerability of all ACTs, including ASPY, across malaria-endemic regions, especially in African children; - further monitoring of efficacy, particularly in children in different settings, and monitoring for adverse events from inadvertent pregnancy exposures; and - identification and validation of molecular markers of resistance to pyronaridine. 5.2.1.1.1 Duration of treatment A 3-day course of the artemisinin component of ACTs covers two asexual cycles, ensuring that only a small fraction of parasites remain for clearance by the", "page_start": 171, "page_end": 172, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Shorter courses (1–2 days) are therefore not recommended, as they are less effective, have less effect on gametocytes and provide less protection for the slowly eliminated partner drug. Strong recommendation for , High certainty evidence Duration of ACT treatment (2015) ACT regimens should provide 3 days’ treatment with an artemisinin derivative. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Desirable effects - Fewer patients taking ACTs containing 3 days of an artemisinin derivative experience treatment failure within the first 28 days (high-quality evidence). - Fewer participants taking ACTs containing 3 days of an artemisinin derivative have gametocytaemia at day 7 (high-quality evidence). Certainty of the High evidence For all critical outcomes:High. Justification GRADE In four randomized controlled trials in which the addition of 3 days of artesunate to SP was compared directly with 1 day of artesunate with SP: Three days of artesunate reduced the PCR-adjusted treatment failure rate within the first 28 days from that with 1 day of artesunate (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.36–0.55, four trials, 1202 participants, high-quality evidence). 172 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Three days of artesunate reduced the number of participants who had gametocytaemia at day 7 from that with 1 day of artesunate (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–0.93, four trials, 1260 participants, high-quality evidence). Other considerations The guideline development group considered that 3 days of artemisinin derivative are necessary to provide sufficient efficacy, promote good adherence and minimize the risk of drug resistance resulting from incomplete treatment. Remarks Longer ACT treatment may be required to achieve > 90% cure rate in areas with artemisinin-resistantP.falciparum, but there are insufficient trials to make definitive recommendations. A 3-day course of the artemisinin component of ACTs covers two asexual cycles, ensuring that only a small fraction of parasites remain for clearance by the partner drug, thus reducing the potential development of resistance to the partner drug.

It is essential to achieve effective antimalarial drug concentrations for a sufficient time (exposure) in all target populations in order to ensure high cure rates.The dosage recommendations below are derived from understanding the relationship between dose and the profiles of exposure to the drug (pharmacokinetics) and the resulting therapeutic efficacy (pharmacodynamics) and safety. Some patient groups, notably younger children, are not dosed optimally with the “dosage regimens recommended by manufacturers, which compromises efficacy and fuels resistance. In these guidelines when there was pharmacological evidence that certain patient groups are not receiving optimal doses, dose regimens were adjusted to ensure similar exposure across all patient groups. Weight-based dosage recommendations are summarized below. While age-based dosing may be more practical in children, the relation between age and weight differs in different populations. Age-based dosing can therefore result in under- dosing or over-dosing of some patients, unless large, region-specific weight-for-age databases are available to guide dosing in that region. Factors other than dosage regimen may also affect exposure to a drug and thus treatment efficacy. The drug exposure of an individual patient also depends on factors such as the quality of the drug, the formulation, adherence and, for some drugs, co-administration with fat. Poor adherence is a major cause of treatment failure and drives the emergence and spread of drug resistance. Fixed-dose combinations encourage adherence and are preferred to loose (individual) tablets. Prescribers should take the time necessary to explain to patients why they should complete antimalarial course. Artemether + lumefantrine Formulations currently available: Dispersible or standard tablets containing 20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine, and standard tablets containing 40 mg artemether and 240 mg lumefantrine in a fixed-dose combination formulation. The flavoured dispersible tablet paediatric formulation facilitates use in young children. Target dose range: A total dose of 5–24 mg/kg bw of artemether and 29–144 mg/ kg bw of lumefantrine Recommended dosage regimen: Artemether + lumefantrine is given twice a day for 3 days (total, six doses). The first two doses should, ideally, be given 8 h apart. Dose (mg) of artemether + lumefantrine given twice daily for Body weight (kg) 3 days < 15 20 + 120 15 to < 25 40 + 240 25 to < 35 60 + 360 173 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) ≥ 35 80 + 480 Factors associated with altered drug exposure and treatment response: - Decreased exposure to lumefantrine has been documented in young children (<3", "page_start": 173, "page_end": 174, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

As these target populations may be at increased risk for treatment failure, their responses to treatment should be monitored more closely and their full adherence ensured. - Increased exposure to lumefantrine has been observed in patients concomitantly taking lopinavir- lopinavir/ritonavir- based antiretroviral agents but with no increase in toxicity; therefore, no dosage adjustment is indicated. Additional comments: - An advantage of this ACT is that lumefantrine is not available as a monotherapy and has never been used alone for the treatment of malaria. - Absorption of lumefantrine is enhanced by co-administration with fat. Patients or caregivers should be informed that this ACT should be taken immediately after food or a fat containing drink (e.g. milk), particularly on the second and third days of treatment. Artesunate + amodiaquine Formulations currently available: A fixed-dose combination in tablets containing 25 + 67.5 mg, 50 + 135 mg or 100 + 270 mg of artesunate and amodiaquine, respectively Target dose and range: The target dose (and range) are 4 (2–10) mg/kg bw per day artesunate and 10 (7.5–15) mg/kg bw per day amodiaquine once a day for 3 days. A total therapeutic dose range of 6–30 mg/kg bw per day artesunate and 22.5–45 mg/kg bw per dose amodiaquine is recommended.

Therefore, their response to artesunate + amodiaquine treatment should be closely monitored. Artesunate + amodiaquine is associated with severe neutropenia, particularly in patients co-infected with HIV and especially in those on zidovudine and/or cotrimoxazole. Concomitant use of efavirenz increases exposure to amodiaquine and hepatotoxicity. Thus, concomitant use of artesunate + amodiaquine by patients taking zidovudine, efavirenz and cotrimoxazole should be avoided, unless this is the only ACT promptly available.

Few data are available on the pharmacokinetics of amodiaquine in the first year of life. 174 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Artesunate + mefloquine Formulations currently available: A fixed-dose formulation of paediatric tablets containing 25 mg artesunate and 55 mg mefloquine hydrochloride (equivalent to 50 mg mefloquine base) and adult tablets containing 100 mg artesunate and 220 mg mefloquine hydrochloride (equivalent to 200 mg mefloquine base) Target dose and range: Target doses (ranges) of 4 (2–10) mg/kg bw per day artesunate and 8.3 (7–11) mg/kg bw per day mefloquine, given once a day for 3 days Body weight (kg) Artesunate + mefloquine dose (mg) given daily for 3 days < 9 25 + 55 9 to < 18 50 + 110 18 to < 30 100 + 220 ≥ 30 200 + 440 Additional comments: Mefloquine was associated with increased incidences of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dysphoria and sleep disturbance in clinical trials, but these symptoms are seldom debilitating, and, where this ACT has been used, it has generally been well tolerated. To reduce acute vomiting and optimize absorption, the total mefloquine dose should preferably be split over 3 days, as in current fixed-dose combinations. As concomitant use of rifampicin decreases exposure to mefloquine, potentially decreasing its efficacy, patients taking this drug should be followed up carefully to identify treatment failures. Artesunate + sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine Formulations: Currently available as blister-packed, scored tablets containing 50 mg artesunate and fixed dose combination tablets comprising 500 mg sulfadoxine + 25 mg pyrimethamine. There is no fixed-dose combination. Target dose and range: A target dose (range) of 4 (2–10) mg/kg bw per day artesunate given once a day for 3 days and a single administration of at least 25 / 1.25 (25–70 / 1.25–3.5) mg/kg bw sulfadoxine / pyrimethamine given as a single dose on day 1.

This may compromise adherence and increase the risk for distribution of loose artesunate tablets, despite the WHO ban on artesunate monotherapy. Resistance is likely to increase with continued widespread use of SP, sulfalene– pyrimethamine and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Fortunately, molecular markers of resistance to antifols and sulfonamides correlate well with therapeutic responses. These should be monitored in areas in which this drug is used. 175 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Strong recommendation for Revised dose recommendation for dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine in young children (2015) Children weighing <25kg treated with dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine should receive a minimum of 2.5 mg/kg bw per day of dihydroartemisinin and 20 mg/ kg bw per day of piperaquine daily for 3 days. *Not evaluated using the GRADE framework Practical info Formulations: Currently available as a fixed-dose combination in tablets containing 40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine and paediatric tablets contain 20 mg dihydroartemisinin and 160 mg piperaquine. Target dose and range:A target dose (range) of 4 (2–10) mg/kg bw per day dihydroartemisinin and 18 (16–27) mg/kg bw per day piperaquine given once a day for 3 days for adults and children weighing ≥ 25 kg. The target doses and ranges for children weighing < 25 kg are 4 (2.5–10) mg/kg bw per day dihydroartemisinin and 24 (20–32) mg/kg bw per day piperaquine once a day for 3 days. Recommended dosage regimen:The dose regimen currently recommended by the manufacturer provides adequate exposure to piperaquine and excellent cure rates (> 95%), except in children < 5 years, who have a threefold increased risk for treatment failure. Children in this age group have significantly lower plasma piperaquine concentrations than older children and adults given the same mg/kg bw dose. Children weighing < 25 kg should receive at least 2.5 mg/kg bw dihydroartemisinin and 20 mg/kg bw piperaquine to achieve the same exposure as children weighing ≥ 25 kg and adults.

Normal meals do not alter the absorption of piperaquine. As malnourished children are at increased risk for treatment failure, their response to treatment should be monitored closely. - Dihydroartemisinin exposure is lower in pregnant women. - Piperaquine is eliminated more rapidly by pregnant women, shortening the post-treatment prophylactic effect of dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine. As this does not affect primary efficacy, no dosage adjustment is recommended for pregnant women. 176 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Additional comments: Piperaquine prolongs the QT interval by approximately the same amount as chloroquine but by less than quinine. It is not necessary to perform an electrocardiogram before prescribing dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine, but this ACT should not be used in patients with congenital QT prolongation or who have a clinical condition or are on medications that prolong the QT interval. There has been no evidence of cardiotoxicity in large randomized trials or in extensive deployment. Justification The dosing subgroup reviewed all available dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine pharmacokinetic data (6 published studies and 10 studies from the WWARN database; total 652 patients)[208][211]and then conducted simulations of piperaquine exposures for each weight group. These showed lower exposure in younger children with higher risks of treatment failure. The revised dose regimens are predicted to provide equivalent piperaquine exposures across all age groups. Other considerations This dose adjustment is not predicted to result in higher peak piperaquine concentrations than in older children and adults, and as there is no evidence of increased toxicity in young children, the GRC concluded that the predicted benefits of improved antimalarial exposure are not at the expense of increased risk. 5.2.1.2 Recurrent falciparum malaria Recurrence ofP. falciparummalaria can result from re-infection or recrudescence (treatment failure). Treatment failure may result from drug resistance or inadequate exposure to the drug due to sub-optimal dosing, poor adherence, vomiting, unusual pharmacokinetics in an individual, or substandard medicines. It is important to determine from the patient’s history whether he or she vomited the previous treatment or did not complete a full course of treatment. When possible, treatment failure must be confirmed parasitologically. This may require referring the patient to a facility with microscopy or LDH-based RDTs, asP. falciparumhistidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2)-based tests may remain positive for weeks after the initial infection, even without recrudescence.

Referral may be necessary anyway to obtain second-line treatment. In individual patients, it may not be possible to distinguish recrudescence from re-infection, although lack of resolution of fever and parasitaemia or their recurrence within 4 weeks of treatment are considered failures of treatment with currently recommended ACTs. In many cases, treatment failures are missed because patients are not asked whether they received antimalarial treatment within the preceding 1–2 months. Patients who present with malaria should be asked this question routinely. Failure within 28 days The recommended second-line treatment is an alternative ACT known to be effective in the region. Adherence to 7-day treatment regimens (with artesunate or quinine both of which should be co-administered with + tetracycline, or doxycycline or clindamycin) is likely to be poor if treatment is not directly observed; these regimens are no longer generally recommended. The distribution and use of oral artesunate monotherapy outside special centres arestrongly discouraged, and quinine- containing regimens are not well tolerated. Failure after 28 days Recurrence of fever and parasitaemia > 4 weeks after treatment may be due to either recrudescence or a new infection. The distinction can be made only by PCR genotyping of parasites from the initial and the recurrent infections. As PCR is not routinely used in patient management, all presumed treatment failures after 4 weeks of initial treatment should, from an operational standpoint, be considered new infections and be treated with the first-line ACT. However, reuse of mefloquine within 60 days of first treatment is associated with an increased risk for neuropsychiatric reactions, and an alternative ACT should be used. 5.2.1.3 Reducing the transmissibility of treated P. falciparum infections in areas of low-intensity transmission 177 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Strong recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Reducing the transmissibility of treatedP. falciparuminfections (2024) In low-transmission areas, a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg bw primaquine should be given with an ACT to patients withP. falciparummalaria (except pregnant women) to reduce transmission. G6PD testing is not required. Practical info In light of concern about the safety of the previously recommended dose of 0.75 mg/kg bw in individuals with G6PD deficiency, a WHO panel reviewed the safety of primaquine as aP. falciparumgametocytocide and concluded that a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg bw of primaquine base is unlikely to cause serious toxicity, even in people with G6PD deficiency[223].

Please refer to thePolicy brief on single-dose primaquine as a gametocytocide in Plasmodium falciparum malaria[225]. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Desirable effects - Single doses of primaquine > 0.4 mg/kg bw reduced gametocyte carriage at day 8 by around two thirds (moderate-quality evidence). - There are too few trials of doses < 0.4 mg/kg bw to quantify the effect on gametocyte carriage (low-quality evidence). - Analysis of observational data from mosquito feeding studies suggests that 0.25 mg/kg bw may rapidly reduce the infectivity of gametocytes to mosquitoes. Undesirable effects - People with severe G6PD deficiency are at risk for haemolysis. At this dose, however, the risk is thought to be small; there are insufficient data to quantify this risk. Certainty of the Low evidence Overall certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes:low. Justification GRADE In an analysis of observational studies of single-dose primaquine, data from mosquito feeding studies on 180 people suggest that adding 0.25 mg/kg primaquine to treatment with an ACT can rapidly reduce the infectivity of gametocytes to mosquitoes. In a systematic review of eight randomized controlled trials of the efficacy of adding single-dose primaquine to ACTs for reducing the transmission of malaria, in comparison with ACTs alone[226]: 178 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - single doses of > 0.4 mg/kg bw primaquine reduced gametocyte carriage at day 8 by about two thirds (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19–0.59, two trials, 269 participants,high-certaintyevidence); and - single doses of primaquine > 0.6 mg/kg bw reduced gametocyte carriage at day 8 by about two thirds (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.22–0.37, seven trials, 1380 participants,high-certainty evidence). There have been no randomized controlled trials of the effects on the incidence of malaria or on transmission to mosquitos. Other considerations The guideline development group considered that the evidence of a dose– response relation from observational studies of mosquito feeding was sufficient to conclude the primaquine dose of 0.25mg/kg bw significantly reducedP. falciparum transmissibility.

Other considerations The guideline development group considered that the evidence of a dose– response relation from observational studies of mosquito feeding was sufficient to conclude the primaquine dose of 0.25mg/kg bw significantly reducedP. falciparum transmissibility. The population benefits of reducing malaria transmission with gametocytocidal drugs such as primaquine require that a very high proportion of treated patients receive these medicines and that there is no large transmission reservoir of asymptomatic parasite carriers. This strategy is therefore likely to be effective only in areas of low-intensity malaria transmission, as a component of elimination programmes. Remarks This recommendation excludes high-transmission settings, as symptomatic patients make up only a small proportion of the total population carrying gametocytes within a community, and primaquine is unlikely to affect transmission. A major concern of national policy-makers in using primaquine has been the small risk for haemolytic toxicity in G6PD-deficient people, especially where G6PD testing is not available. Life-threatening haemolysis is considered unlikely with the 0.25mg/kg bw dose and without G6PD testing[227]. Rationale for the recommendation The Guideline Development Group considered the evidence on dose–response relations in the observational mosquito-feeding studies of reduced transmissibility with the dose of 0.25 mg/kg bw and the judgement of the WHO Evidence Review Group (November 2012). Their view was that the potential public health benefits of single low-dose (0.25 mg/kg bw) primaquine in addition to an ACT for falciparum malaria, without G6PD testing, outweigh the potential risk for adverse effects. 5.2.1.4 Special risk groups 179 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Several important patient sub-populations, including young children, pregnant women and patients taking potent enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, efavirenz), have altered pharmacokinetics, resulting in sub-optimal exposure to antimalarial drugs. This increases the rate of treatment failure with current dosage regimens. The rates of treatment failure are substantially higher in hyperparasitaemic patients and patients in areas with artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria, and these groups require greater exposure to antimalarial drugs (longer duration of therapeutic concentrations) than is achieved with current ACT dosage recommendations. It is often uncertain how best to achieve this. Options include increasing individual doses, changing the frequency or duration of dosing, or adding an additional antimalarial drug. Increasing individual doses may not, however, achieve the desired exposure (e.g., lumefantrine absorption becomes saturated), or the dose may be toxic due to transiently high plasma concentrations (piperaquine, mefloquine, amodiaquine, pyronaridine). An additional advantage of lengthening the duration of treatment (by giving a 5-day regimen) is that it provides additional exposure of the asexual cycle to the artemisinin component as well as augmenting exposure to the partner drug. The acceptability, tolerability, safety and effectiveness of augmented ACT regimens in these special circumstances should be evaluated urgently.

The acceptability, tolerability, safety and effectiveness of augmented ACT regimens in these special circumstances should be evaluated urgently. Large and obese adults Large adults are at risk for under-dosing when they are dosed by age or in standard pre-packaged adult weight-based treatments. In principle, dosing of large adults should be based on achieving the target mg/kg bw dose for each antimalarial regimen. The practical consequence is that two packs of an antimalarial drug might have to be opened to ensure adequate treatment. For obese patients, less drug is often distributed to fat than to other tissues; therefore, they should be dosed on the basis of an estimate of lean body weight, ideal body weight. Patients who are heavy but not obese require the same mg/kg bw doses as lighter patients. In the past, maximum doses have been recommended, but there is no evidence or justification for this practice. As the evidence for an association between dose, pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome in overweight or large adults is limited, and alternative dosing options have not been assessed in treatment trials, it is recommended that this gap in knowledge be assessed urgently. In the absence of data, treatment providers should attempt to follow up the treatment outcomes of large adults whenever possible. 5.2.1.4.1 Pregnant and lactating women Malaria in pregnancy is associated with low-birth-weight infants, increased anaemia and, in low-transmission areas, increased risks for severe malaria, pregnancy loss and death. In high-transmission settings, despite the adverse effects on fetal growth, malaria is usually asymptomatic in pregnancy or is associated with only mild, non-specific symptoms. There is insufficient information on the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of most antimalarial agents in pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester. First trimester of pregnancy Malaria in pregnancy is associated with low birthweight in infants, increased anaemia and, in low-transmission areas, increased risks for severe malaria, pregnancy loss and death. Malaria in pregnancy is, therefore, considered a priority problem. The risk of malaria infection is said to be highest in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy[226]. In a study in Benin, the prevalence of malaria infection in the first trimester was 21.8% and was significantly associated with maternal anaemia in the third trimester (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.11–4.55)[227]. A modelling study among women in areas of stable malaria transmission suggested that over 60% of malaria infections during pregnancy occur by the end of the first trimester[228]. Although ACTs have been shown to be more effective and better tolerated and provide longer post-treatment prophylaxis than oral quinine in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, to date, WHO had recommended quinine + clindamycin instead of ACTs for the first trimester. This recommendation was due to concerns about the potential teratogenicity of the artemisinin observed in", "page_start": 180, "page_end": 180, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Although ACTs have been shown to be more effective and better tolerated and provide longer post-treatment prophylaxis than oral quinine in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, to date, WHO had recommended quinine + clindamycin instead of ACTs for the first trimester. This recommendation was due to concerns about the potential teratogenicity of the artemisinin observed in pre-clinical animal studies[229][230]. WHO has generated a new recommendation based on a review of all updated evidence to date on the risks and benefits of using any ACT compared to quinine for the treatment of uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria in the first trimester of pregnancy. The new recommendation is given in the box below. Second and third trimesters Experience with artemisinin derivatives in the second and third trimesters (over 4000 documented pregnancies) is increasingly reassuring: no adverse effects on the mother or fetus have been reported. The current assessment of risk–benefit suggests that ACTs should be used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The current standard six-dose artemether + lumefantrine regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria has been evaluated in > 1000 women in the second and third trimesters in controlled 180 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) trials and has been found to be well tolerated and safe. In a low-transmission setting on the Myanmar–Thailand border, however, the efficacy of the standard six-dose artemether + lumefantrine regimen was inferior to 7 days of artesunate monotherapy. The lower efficacy may have been due to lower drug concentrations in pregnancy, as was also recently observed in a high-transmission area in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. Although many women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy in Africa have been exposed to artemether + lumefantrine, further studies are under way to evaluate its efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety in pregnant women. Similarly, many pregnant women in Africa have been treated with amodiaquine alone or combined with SP or artesunate; however, amodiaquine use for the treatment of malaria in pregnancy has been formally documented in only > 1300 pregnancies. Use of amodiaquine in women in Ghana in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with frequent minor side- effects but not with liver toxicity, bone marrow depression or adverse neonatal outcomes. Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine was used successfully in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy in > 2000 women on the Myanmar–Thailand border for rescue therapy and in Indonesia for first-line treatment. SP, although considered safe, is not appropriate for use as an artesunate partner drug in many areas because of resistance to SP. If artesunate + SP is used for treatment, co-administration of daily high doses (5 mg) of folate supplementation should be avoided, as this compromises the efficacy of SP.

A lower dose of folate (0.4–0.5 mg bw/day) or a treatment other than artesunate + SP should be used. Mefloquine is considered safe for the treatment of malaria during the second and third trimesters; however, it should be given only in combination with an artemisinin derivative. Quinine is associated with an increased risk for hypoglycaemia in late pregnancy, and it should be used (with clindamycin) only if effective alternatives are not available. Primaquine and tetracyclines should not be used in pregnancy. Dosing in pregnancy Data on the pharmacokinetics of antimalarial agents used during pregnancy are limited. Those available indicate that pharmacokinetic properties are often altered during pregnancy but that the alterations are insufficient to warrant dose modifications at this time. With quinine, no significant differences in exposure have been seen during pregnancy. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of SP used in IPTp in many sites show significantly decreased exposure to sulfadoxine, but the findings on exposure to pyrimethamine are inconsistent. Therefore, no dose modification is warranted at this time. Studies are available of the pharmacokinetics of artemether + lumefantrine, artesunate + mefloquine and dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine. Most data exist for artemether + lumefantrine; these suggest decreased overall exposure during the second and third trimesters. Simulations suggest that a standard six-dose regimen of lumefantrine given over 5 days, rather than 3 days, improves exposure, but the data are insufficient to recommend this alternative regimen at present. Limited data on pregnant women treated with dihydroartemesinin + piperaquine suggest lower dihydroartemisinin exposure and no overall difference in total piperaquine exposure, but a shortened piperaquine elimination half-life was noted. The data on artesunate + mefloquine are insufficient to recommend an adjustment of dosage. No data are available on the pharmacokinetics of artesunate + amodiaquine in pregnant women with falciparum malaria, although drug exposure was similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women with vivax malaria. Lactating women The amounts of antimalarial drugs that enter breast milk and are consumed by breastfeeding infants are relatively small. Tetracycline is contraindicated in breastfeeding mothers because of its potential effect on infants’ bones and teeth. Pending further information on excretion in breast milk, primaquine should not be used for nursing women, unless the breastfed infant has been checked for G6PD deficiency. 181 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Strong recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Treatment in the first trimester of pregnancy (2022) Pregnant women with uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria should be treated with artemether-lumefantrine during the first trimester. - Limited exposures to other ACTs (artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine and dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine) suggest that the current evidence", "page_start": 181, "page_end": 182, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Evidence to decision Benefits and harms ACTs have large positive effects with respect to efficacy, effectiveness and tolerability compared to quinine in non-pregnant patients and women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Systematic reviews have shown that treatment failures are six times more likely with quinine than with artemether-lumefantrine in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy[231][232]. In various animal studies (including rodents and monkeys), artemisinin has been found to deplete embryonic erythroblasts at relatively low doses of 1/200–1/400 of the LD50 (equivalent to > 10 mg/kg body weight), leading to malformation or embryonic death[229][233]. The adverse effects include embryo resorption, pregnancy loss and congenital anomalies, including shortening of the long bones and heart defects (ventricular septal and great vessel defects)[234][235]. For this reason, despite its demonstrated lower efficacy in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, quinine (in combination with clindamycin) was retained by WHO in 2015 for treatment in the first trimester until adequate numbers of human exposures to artemisinin could allow for more safety assessments in humans. In weighing the risk–benefit ratio, safety risks from antimalarial treatment need to be weighed against the adverse effects of malaria in the first trimester[236]. A recently updated individual patient data meta-analysis of 34 178 pregnancies included 737 well documented pregnancies exposed to artemisinin and 1076 exposed to non-artemisinin-based treatments in the first trimester. Of the exposures to artemisinin, 71% (525) were to artemether- lumefantrine[237].

Of the exposures to artemisinin, 71% (525) were to artemether- lumefantrine[237]. This meta-analysis provided the basis for the re-evaluation of the treatment of malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy. This updated individual patient data review showed that first-trimester treatment with artemether- lumefantrine was associated with significantly fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes than first- trimester treatment with quinine. Treatment with artemether-lumefantrine in the first trimester was associated with a statistically significant lower risk (42%) of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to treatment with oral quinine (aHR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.36–0.92)[237]. The numbers of exposures to the other ACTs (excluding artesunate-pyronaridine) were too small to allow for a subgroup analysis[237]. There is currently no documented record of the use of artesunate- pyronaridine during the first trimester of pregnancy. Combined with the known better tolerability 182 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) and effectiveness and the longer duration of post-treatment prophylaxis, artemether-lumefantrine clearly has a more favourable risk–benefit profile than quinine for treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the first trimester. An analysis of all exposures to artemisinin-based treatment (ABT) in the first trimester of pregnancy as a means of addressing the concerns previously demonstrated in animal studies showed no differences between pregnancies exposed in the first trimester to artemisinin and those exposed to non-ABT in terms of the composite adverse pregnancy outcome (ABT=42/736 [5.7%] vs non-ABT=96/1074 [8.9%]; aHR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49–1.03). Analysis for adverse pregnancy outcomes against the individual parameters in the composite analysis, including miscarriage, stillbirth or congenital anomalies, also revealed no statistically significant difference. There was also no difference in the risk of these adverse pregnancy outcomes when exposures were restricted to the putative embryo-sensitive period. This meta-analysis had 8126 additional pregnancies with 60 additional artemisinin exposures in the first trimester compared to the review published in 2017[238]. This analysis[237]strengthens previous findings of the 2017 review that the potential for artemisinin-based embryotoxicity observed in animal studies is not reflected in humans treated for malaria. The analysis also demonstrates how few pregnancy outcomes after ACT exposures in the first trimester of pregnancy can be documented. The teratogenic effect of the artemisinin observed in animal studies was not apparent in any of the reviewed data on human exposure to ACTs in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, there are some reasons to exercise caution in drawing a definite conclusion on the safety of the artemisinin derivatives as a drug class. These reasons include: the possibility of immortal time bias, resulting in an inability to detect early fetal losses; potential bias in observational study designs with exposure to quinine as the main", "page_start": 182, "page_end": 183, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

These reasons include: the possibility of immortal time bias, resulting in an inability to detect early fetal losses; potential bias in observational study designs with exposure to quinine as the main comparator; and current limited postnatal evaluation, e.g. for cardiovascular and other malformations[239]. In addition, most of the safety data are on artemether-lumefantrine. Although artemisinin derivatives are rapidly converted to dihydroartemisinin as their active metabolite, differences between the different derivatives, or differences caused by the combination with different partner drugs cannot be excluded. In terms of the safety and tolerability of the currently recommended ACT partner antimalarials, the antifolate sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is contraindicated during the first trimester of pregnancy, as it is known to have a potential teratogenic risk in humans at therapeutic doses[240]. There is currently no documented exposure to pyronaridine in the first trimester of pregnancy. Among 3428 pregnant women in the second or third trimester treated with an ACT forP. falciparummalaria (at any parasite density and regardless of symptoms), drug-related adverse events such as asthenia, poor appetite, dizziness, nausea and vomiting occurred significantly more frequently in the artesunate-mefloquine group (50.6%) and the artesunate-amodiaquine group (48.5%) than in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group (20.6%) and the artemether-lumefantrine group (11.5%) (p<0.001 for comparison among the four groups)[241]. There is a lack of documented exposures very early in gestation (gestational weeks 4–10), which is considered a critical period for teratogenic risk. Therefore, the potential for any given medicine, including quinine, to cause a specific teratogenic effect can only be reliably ascertained when it has been administered during this sensitive period (which is almost impossible to study, given how soon this critical window occurs after the last menstrual period)[239]. Certainty of the Low evidence The GDG judged the overall certainty of the assessed evidence across the different outcomes to be low due to bias inherent in observational studies. It was difficult to generalize across all ACTs because of the limited number of pregnant women in the first trimester treated with ACTs other than artemether-lumefantrine who were included in the review.

Policy-makers and implementers will obviously prefer simplified recommendations on using artemether-lumefantrine or other ACTs to treat pregnant women with uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria across all trimesters. According to a systematic review of sociocultural factors[242], malaria in pregnancy is interpreted in locally defined categories, despite the higher malaria risk associated with pregnancy. Local context and health workers’ ideas and comments influence concerns about malaria in pregnancy interventions. Factors such as the understanding of antenatal care, health worker–client interactions, household decision-making, gender relations, cost and distance to health facilities affect pregnant women’s access to these interventions and their health-seeking behaviour. It is difficult to ascertain whether any sociocultural factors would result in variability in the likely preference for artemether-lumefantrine or other ACTs over quinine treatment. Resources Research evidence ACTs, of which artemether-lumefantrine is the most widely used, are the treatment of choice for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in nearly all malaria-endemic countries and are thus readily available. Conversely, the supply of quinine has become problematic because of the small proportion of the total population that receive this antimalarial treatment. Clindamycin, which is recommended in combination with quinine, is commonly unavailable and unaffordable in most endemic regions. In addition, the quinine + clindamycin regime is associated with a high pill burden, requiring between 56 and 70 tablets to be ingested over a seven-day period. In most country programmes, quinine monotherapy is thus currently recommended in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, in some countries in eastern and southern Africa, quinine is rarely available in public facilities, and many pregnant women in the first trimester are already being treated with artemether-lumefantrine, based on reports from the national malaria programmes. Aligning the first-line treatment of uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria for the first trimester with that currently recommended for the second and third trimesters would simplify case management, service delivery, communications and supply chain management.

However, health equity will increase, especially for vulnerable populations, if this more effective, more accessible and better tolerated treatment is recommended for the management of malaria in all trimesters of pregnancy. Acceptability In considering the acceptability of artemether-lumefantrine versus quinine treatments, the GDG looked to how quinine is presently being used and accepted. Adherence to quinine is low because it is frequently associated with adverse effects, including cinchonism, nausea and hypoglycaemia[231][243][244]. In a review of 35 national guidelines, 66% recommended oral quinine as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy. Of these, only 29% included the combined use with clindamycin in their guidelines, reflecting the unavailability and/or cost of clindamycin[245]. Health care reliance on clinical diagnosis and poor adherence to treatment policy, especially in the first trimester, have been consistently reported. Prescribing practices have been driven by concerns over side effects and drug safety, patient preferences, drug availability and cost[246]. With poor adherence to the presently recommended quinine-based treatments and better access to ACTs, it appears that artemether-lumefantrine will be a more acceptable option. A three-day ACT treatment regimen is likely to be more acceptable than a seven-day treatment with quinine. Policy-makers and health care workers will likely welcome the evidence-based decision recommending artemether-lumefantrine for all trimesters of pregnancy. In situations where artemether-lumefantrine is no longer recommended for the treatment of malaria because of reduced efficacy and/or it is not promptly available, the use of some of the other ACTs recommended in national guidelines can be considered, given the demonstrated poorer outcomes of quinine", "page_start": 184, "page_end": 185, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

However, artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine cannot be recommended in the first trimester of pregnancy given the potential teratogenicity of antifolates. Furthermore, the lack of documented outcomes following the use of artesunate-pyronaridine precludes its use in the first trimester. Feasibility One consideration in determining the feasibility of the recommendation on treatment of malaria in the first trimester is that the existing warning against the use of artemisinin in the first trimester implies the need to consistently screen for pregnancy among all women of childbearing potential prior to treatment for malaria. However, pregnancy screening is rarely done prior to initiating malaria treatment. As observed by national programmes, the contraindication of artemisinin in the first trimester has resulted in confusion, most problematically resulting in pregnant women in the first trimester with severe malaria not receiving the recommended parenteral artesunate, thereby increasing malaria morbidity and mortality in this particularly vulnerable subgroup[248][249]. Given that ACTs, particularly artemether-lumefantrine, are already widely used in the treatment of malaria in pregnancy, although mainly in the second and third trimesters, uptake of artemether- lumefantrine (and other ACTs) should be feasible in the first trimester of pregnancy. There will also be less confusion once the recommendations are aligned across all trimesters of pregnancy, implying that artemether-lumefantrine or other ACTs should be more feasible and adherence to the implementation strategies should improve relative to that with quinine-based treatment. Justification The GDG reached a consensus on a strong recommendation for artemether-lumefantrine as the preferred treatment of uncomplicatedPlasmodium falciparummalaria during the first trimester of pregnancy, despite the low certainty of evidence because: - there was a large magnitude of beneficial effect of treatment on efficacy (demonstrated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy), specifically a six-fold reduction in treatment failures following artemether-lumefantrine, compared to the currently recommended quinine-based therapies; - artemether-lumefantrine was associated with trivial adverse events and significantly lower risk for adverse pregnancy 185 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) outcomes in the first trimester of pregnancy; - artemether-lumefantrine had much better tolerability compared to quinine-based therapies; and - there is probably increased equity, acceptability and feasibility, resulting from better access to artemether-lumefantrine and more efficient implementation of ACTs compared to quinine-based treatments. Despite limited exposures to other ACTs (artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine and dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine), the current evidence does not raise any concerns. However, consistent with the previous WHO recommendation that provided for limited use of ACTs if the first-line recommended medicine", "page_start": 185, "page_end": 186, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Despite limited exposures to other ACTs (artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine and dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine), the current evidence does not raise any concerns. However, consistent with the previous WHO recommendation that provided for limited use of ACTs if the first-line recommended medicine was not available, these other ACTs may be used where artemether-lumefantrine is not a recommended ACT for uncomplicated malaria or is not available, given the demonstrated poorer outcomes of quinine treatment, along with the challenges of adherence to a seven-day course of treatment. Exceptions are where the ACT partner drug is contraindicated, for example sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine, or its safety is unknown, for example pyronaridine. These three alternative ACTs (artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) are considered preferable to quinine-based treatments in the first trimester, as the latter are not as effective, not well tolerated and adherence is more challenging. Furthermore, quinine, the current WHO-recommended treatment, is associated with similar risks of poor birth outcomes compared to ACTs overall. Research needs - Although the safety of ACTs is reassuring and the independent patient data meta-analysis indicated that there is no apparent effect of gestational age on the risk of PCR-corrected treatment efficacy, collecting further evidence from clinical studies and close surveillance on the safety of ACT treatment in the first trimester must be continued and funded. This is particularly the case for artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine and artesunate-pyronaridine, given the relatively few pregnant women in the first trimester with documented exposures to these drugs compared to artemether-lumefantrine. - Operational studies including pregnancy registries are needed to strengthen pharmacovigilance among pregnant women and capture data from mass drug administration programmes and other interventions that may result in inadvertent exposures to ACTs during the first trimester. - Continued pharmacovigilance and clinical research, such as controlled experimental studies on the efficacy and safety of antimalarial medicines, including new antimalarials, for the treatment of malaria in pregnancy, should be supported and funded given the high burden of malaria in pregnancy globally. 5.2.1.4.2 Young children and infants Artemisinin derivatives are safe and well tolerated by young children; therefore, the choice of ACT is determined largely by the safety and tolerability of the partner drug. SP (with artesunate) should be avoided in the first weeks of life because it displaces bilirubin competitively and could thus aggravate neonatal hyperbilibinaemia. Primaquine should be avoided in the first 6 months of life (although there are no data on its toxicity in infants), and tetracyclines should be avoided throughout infancy. With these exceptions, none of the other currently recommended antimalarial treatments has shown serious toxicity in infancy.

Delay in treatingP. falciparummalaria in infants and young children can have fatal consequences, particularly for more severe infections. The uncertainties noted above should not delay treatment with the most effective drugs available. In treating young children, it is important to ensure accurate dosing and retention of the administered dose, as infants are more likely to vomit or regurgitate antimalarial treatment than older children or adults. Taste, volume, consistency and gastrointestinal tolerability are important determinants of whether the child retains the treatment. Mothers often need advice on techniques of drug administration and the importance of administering the drug again if it is regurgitated within 1 h of administration. Because deterioration in infants can be rapid, the threshold for use of parenteral treatment should be much lower. Optimal antimalarial dosing in young children Although dosing on the basis of body area is recommended for many drugs in young children, for the sake of simplicity, antimalarial drugs have been administered as a standard dose per kg bw for all patients, including young children and infants. This approach does not take into account changes in drug disposition that occur with development. The currently recommended doses of lumefantrine, piperaquine, SP, artesunate and chloroquine result in lower drug concentrations in young children and infants than in older patients. Adjustments to previous dosing regimens for dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine in uncomplicated malaria and for artesunate in severe malaria are now recommended to improve the drug 186 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) exposure in this vulnerable population. The available evidence for artemether + lumefantrine, SP and chloroquine does not indicate dose modification at this time, but young children should be closely monitored, as reduced drug exposure may increase the risk for treatment failure. Limited studies of amodiaquine and mefloquine showed no significant effect of age on plasma concentration profiles. In community situations where parenteral treatment is needed but cannot be given, such as for infants and young children who vomit antimalarial drugs repeatedly or are too weak to swallow or are very ill, give rectal artesunate and transfer the patient to a facility in which parenteral treatment is possible. Rectal administration of a single dose of artesunate as pre- referral treatment reduces the risks for death and neurological disability, as long as this initial treatment is followed by appropriate parenteral antimalarial treatment in hospital.

Optimal antimalarial dosing in infants See recommendation for Infants less than 5 kg body weight below. Optimal antimalarial dosing in malnourished young children Malaria and malnutrition frequently coexist. Malnutrition may result in inaccurate dosing when doses are based on age (a dose may be too high for an infant with a low weight for age) or on weight (a dose may be too low for an infant with a low weight for age). Although many studies of the efficacy of antimalarial drugs have been conducted in populations and settings where malnutrition was prevalent, there are few studies of the disposition of the drugs specifically in malnourished individuals, and these seldom distinguished between acute and chronic malnutrition. Oral absorption of drugs may be reduced if there is diarrhoea or vomiting, or rapid gut transit or atrophy of the small bowel mucosa. Absorption of intramuscular and possibly intrarectal drugs may be slower, and diminished muscle mass may make it difficult to administer repeated intramuscular injections to malnourished patients. The volume of distribution of some drugs may be larger and the plasma concentrations lower. Hypoalbuminaemia may reduce protein binding and increase metabolic clearance, but concomitant hepatic dysfunction may reduce the metabolism of some drugs; the net result is uncertain. Small studies of the pharmacokinetics of quinine and chloroquine showed alterations in people with different degrees of malnutrition. Studies of SP in IPTp and of amodiaquine monotherapy and dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine for treatment suggest reduced efficacy in malnourished children. A pooled analysis of data for individual patients showed that the concentrations of lumefantrine on day 7 were lower in children < 3 years who were underweight for age than in adequately nourished children and adults. Although these findings are concerning, they are insufficient to warrant dose modifications (in mg/kg bw) of any antimalarial drug in patients with malnutrition.

Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Undesirable effects: 187 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - There is some evidence that artemether + lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine may achieve lower plasma concentrations in infants than in older children and adults. Justification Evidence supporting the recommendation Data available were not suitable for evaluation using the GRADE methodology. In most clinical studies, subgroups of infants and older children were not distinguished, and the evidence for young infants (< 5 kg) is insufficient for confidence in current treatment recommendations. Nevertheless, despite these uncertainties, infants need prompt, effective treatment of malaria. There is limited evidence that artemether + lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine achieve lower plasma concentrations in infants than in older children and adults. Other considerations The Guideline Development Group considered the currently available evidence too limited to warrant formal evidence review at this stage, and was unable to recommend any changes beyond the status quo. Further research is warranted. Rationale for the recommendation Treat infants weighing < 5 kg with uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria with an ACT. The weight-adjusted dose should achieve the same mg/kg bw target dose as for children weighing 5 kg. 5.2.1.4.3 Patients co-infected with HIV There is considerable geographical overlap between malaria and HIV infection, and many people are co-infected. Worsening HIV-related immunosuppression may lead to more severe manifestations of malaria. In HIV-infected pregnant women, the adverse effects of placental malaria on birth weight are increased. In areas of stable endemic malaria, HIV- infected patients who are partially immune to malaria may have more frequent, higher-density infections, while in areas of unstable transmission, HIV infection is associated with increased risks for severe malaria and malaria-related deaths. Limited information is available on how HIV infection modifies therapeutic responses to ACTs. Early studies suggested that increasing HIV-related immunosuppression was associated with decreased treatment response to antimalarial drugs. There is presently insufficient information to modify the general malaria treatment recommendations for patients with HIV/ AIDS. Patients co-infected with tuberculosis Rifamycins, in particular rifampicin, are potent CYP3A4 inducers with weak antimalarial activity. Concomitant administration of rifampicin during quinine treatment of adults with malaria was associated with a significant decrease in exposure to quinine and a five-fold higher recrudescence rate. Similarly, concomitant rifampicin with mefloquine in healthy adults was associated with a three-fold decrease in exposure to mefloquine.

In adults co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis who were being treated with rifampicin, administration of artemether + lumefantrine resulted in significantly lower exposure to artemether, dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine (nine-, six- and three-fold decreases, respectively).There is insufficient evidence at this time to change the current mg/kg bw dosing recommendations; however, as these patients are at higher risk of recrudescent infections they should be monitored closely. Practice Statement Patients co-infected with HIV (2015) In people who have HIV/AIDS and uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria, artesunate + SP is not recommended if they are being treated with co-trimoxazole, and artesunate + amodiaquine is not recommended if they are being treated with efavirenz or zidovudine. Justification More data are available on use of artemether + lumefantrine with antiretroviral treatment. A study in children with uncomplicated malaria in a high-transmission area of Africa showed a decreased risk for recurrent malaria after treatment with artemether + lumefantrine in children receiving lopinavir–ritonavir- based antiretroviral treatment as compared with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based 188 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) antiretroviral treatment. Evaluation of pharmacokinetics in these children and in healthy volunteers showed significantly higher exposure to lumefantrine and lower exposure to dihydroartemisinin with lopinavir–ritonavir-based antiretroviral treatment, but no adverse consequences. Conversely, efavirenz- based antiretroviral treatment was associated with a two- to fourfold decrease in exposure to lumefantrine in healthy volunteers and malaria-infected adults and children, with increased rates of recurrent malaria after treatment. Close monitoring is required. Increasing artemether + lumefantrine dosing with efavirenz- based antiretroviral treatment has not yet been studied. Exposure to lumefantrine and other non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based antiretroviral treatment, namely nevirapine and etravirine, did not show consistent changes that would require dose adjustment. Studies of administration of quinine with lopinavir–ritonavir or ritonavir alone in healthy volunteers gave conflicting results. The combined data are insufficient to justify dose adjustment. Single-dose atovaquone–proguanil with efavirenz, lopinavir–ritonavir or atazanavir–ritonavir were all associated with a significantly decreased area under the concentration–time curve for atovaquone (two- to fourfold) and proguanil (twofold), which could well compromise treatment or prophylactic efficacy. There is insufficient evidence to change the current mg/kg bw dosing recommendations; however, these patients should also be monitored closely. 5.2.1.4.4 Non-immune travellers Travellers who acquire malaria are often non-immune people living in cities in endemic countries with little or no transmission or are visitors from non-endemic countries travelling to areas with malaria transmission.

Both are at higher risk for severe malaria. In a malaria-endemic country, they should be treated according to national policy, provided the treatment recommended has a recent proven cure rate > 90%. Travellers who return to a non-endemic country and then develop malaria present a particular problem, and the case fatality rate is often high; doctors in non-malarious areas may be unfamiliar with malaria and the diagnosis is commonly delayed, and effective antimalarial drugs may not be registered or may be unavailable. However, prevention of transmission or the emergence of resistance are not relevant outside malaria-endemic areas. If the patient has taken chemoprophylaxis, the same medicine should not be used for treatment. Treatment ofP. vivax,P. ovaleandP. malariaemalaria in travellers should be the same as for patients in endemic areas (see section 5.4). There may be delays in obtaining artesunate, artemether or quinine for the management of severe malaria outside endemic areas. If only parenteral quinidine is available, it should be given, with careful clinical and electrocardiographic monitoring (see section 5.5 Treating severe malaria). Strong recommendation for , High certainty evidence Non-immune travellers (2015) Travellers with uncomplicatedP. falciparummalaria returning to non-endemic settings should be treated with an ACT. Evidence to decision Certainty of the High evidence Justification GRADE Studies have consistently demonstrated that the five WHO recommended ACTs have less than 5% PCR-adjusted treatment failure rates in settings without resistance to the partner drug (high quality evidence). Other considerations The Guideline Development Group considered the evidence of superiority of ACTs over non-ACTs from endemic settings to be equally applicable to those travelling from non-endemic settings. 189 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 5.2.1.4.5 Uncomplicated hyperparasitaemia Uncomplicated hyperparasitaemia is present in patients who have ≥ 4% parasitaemia but no signs of severity. They are at increased risk for severe malaria and for treatment failure and are considered an important source of antimalarial drug resistance. Practice Statement Hyperparasitaemia (2015) People withP. falciparumhyperparasitaemia are at increased risk for treatment failure, severe malaria and death and should be closely monitored, in addition to receiving an ACT. Justification In falciparum malaria, the risk for progression to severe malaria with vital organ dysfunction increases at higher parasite densities. In low-transmission settings, mortality begins to increase when the parasite density exceeds 100 000/μL (~2% parasitaemia). On the north-west border of Thailand, before the general introduction of ACT, parasitaemia > 4% without signs of severity was associated with a 3% mortality rate (about 30-times higher than from uncomplicated falciparum malaria with lower densities) and a six-times higher risk of treatment failure. The relationship between parasitaemia and risks depends on the epidemiological context: in higher-transmission settings, the risk of developing severe malaria in patients with high parasitaemia", "page_start": 189, "page_end": 190, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The relationship between parasitaemia and risks depends on the epidemiological context: in higher-transmission settings, the risk of developing severe malaria in patients with high parasitaemia is lower, but “uncomplicated hyperparasitaemia” is still associated with a significantly higher rate of treatment failure. Patients with a parasitaemia of 4–10% and no signs of severity also require close monitoring, and, if feasible, admission to hospital. They have high rates of treatment failure. Non-immune people such as travellers and individuals in low- transmission settings with a parasitaemia > 2% are at increased risk and also require close attention. Parasitaemia > 10% is considered to indicate severe malaria in all settings. It is difficult to make a general recommendation about treatment of uncomplicated hyperparasitaemia, for several reasons: recognizing these patients requires an accurate, quantitative parasite count (they will not be identified from semi- quantitative thick film counts or RDTs), the risks for severe malaria vary considerably, and the risks for treatment failure also vary. Furthermore, little information is available on therapeutic responses in uncomplicated hyperparasitaemia. As the artemisinin component of an ACT is essential in preventing progression to severe malaria, absorption of the first dose must be ensured (atovaquone – proguanil alone should not be used for travellers presenting with uncomplicated hyperparasitaemia). Longer courses of treatment are more effective; both giving longer courses of ACT and preceding the standard 3-day ACT regimen with parenteral or oral artesunate have been used. 5.2.1.5 Uncomplicated malaria caused by P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae or P. knowlesi Plasmodium vivaxaccounts for approximately half of all malaria cases outside Africa[3][250][251]. It is prevalentin the Middle East, Asia, the Western Pacific and Central and South America. With the exception of the Horn, it is rarer in Africa, where there is a high prevalence of the Duffy-negative phenotype, particularly in West Africa, although cases are reported in both Mauritania and Mali[251]. In most areas whereP. vivaxis prevalent, the malaria transmission rates are low (except on the island of New Guinea). Affected populations achieve only partial immunity to this parasite, and so people of all ages are at risk forP. vivaxmalaria[251]. Where bothP.falciparumandP. vivaxare prevalent, the incidence rates ofP. vivaxtend to peak at a younger age than forP. falciparum. This is because eachP. vivaxinoculation may be followed by several relapses. The other human malaria parasite species,P.malariaeandP. ovale(which is in fact two sympatric species), are less common.P. knowlesi, a simian parasite, causes occasional cases of malaria in or near forested areas of South-East Asia and the Indian subcontinent[252].

In parts of the island of Borneo,P. knowlesiis the predominant cause of human malaria and an important cause of severe malaria Of the six species ofPlasmodiumthat affect humans, onlyP. vivaxand the two species ofP. ovale[253]form hypnozoites, which are dormant parasite stages in the liver that cause relapse weeks to years after the primary infection.P. vivax preferentially invades reticulocytes, and repeated illness causes chronic anaemia, which can be debilitating and sometimes 190 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) life-threatening, particularly in young children[254]. Recurrent vivax malaria is an important impediment to human and economic development in affected populations. In areas whereP. falciparumandP.vivaxco-exist, intensive malaria control often has a greater effect onP. falciparum, asP. vivax,is more resilient to interventions. AlthoughP. vivaxhas been considered to be a benign form of malaria, it may sometimes cause severe disease[255]. The major complication is anaemia in young children. In Papua province, Indonesia[255], and in Papua New Guinea[256], where malaria transmission is intense,P. vivaxis an important cause of malaria morbidity and mortality, particularly in young infants and children. Occasionally, older patients develop vital organ involvement similar to that in severe and complicatedP. falciparummalaria[257][258]. During pregnancy, infection withP. vivax, as withP. falciparum, increases the risk for abortion and reduces birth weight[259][207]. In primigravidae, the reduction in birth weight is approximately two thirds that associated withP. falciparum.In one large series, this effect increased with successive pregnancies[259]. P. knowlesiis a zoonosis that normally affects long- and pig-tailed macaque monkeys. It has a daily asexual cycle, resulting in a rapid replication rate and high parasitaemia.P. knowlesimay cause a fulminant disease similar to severe falciparum malaria (with the exception of coma, which does not occur)[260][261]. Co-infection with other species is common. Diagnosis Diagnosis ofP. vivax,P. ovale, andP. malariaemalaria is based on microscopy.P. knowlesiis frequently misdiagnosed under the microscope, as the young ring forms are similar to those ofP. falciparum, the late trophozoites are similar to those ofP. malariae, and parasite development is asynchronous. Rapid diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic methods are available for the detection ofP. vivaxmalaria; however, they are relatively insensitive for detectingP. malariaeandP. ovale parasitaemia. Rapid diagnostic antigen tests for humanPlasmodiumspecies show poor sensitivity forP.knowlesiinfections in humans with low parasitaemia[262]. Treatment The objectives of treatment of vivax malaria are twofold: to cure the acute blood stage infection and to clear hypnozoites from the liver to prevent future relapses. This is known as “radical cure”. In areas with chloroquine-sensitiveP. vivax For chloroquine-sensitive vivax malaria, oral chloroquine at a total dose of 25 mg base/kg bw is effective and well tolerated.

In the past, the initial 10 mg/kg bw dose was followed by 5 mg/kg bw at 6 h, 24 h and 48 h. As residual chloroquine suppresses the first relapse of tropicalP. vivax(which emerges about 3 weeks after onset of the primary illness), relapses begin to occur 5–7 weeks after treatment if radical curative treatment with primaquine is not given. ACTs are highly effective in the treatment of vivax malaria, allowing simplification (unification) of malaria treatment; i.e. all malaria infections can be treated with an ACT. The exception is artesunate + SP, where resistance significantly compromises its efficacy. Although good efficacy of artesunate + SP was reported in one study in Afghanistan, in several other areas (such as South-East Asia)P. vivaxhas become resistant to SP more rapidly thanP. falciparum.The initial response to all ACTs is rapid in vivax malaria, reflecting the high sensitivity to artemisinin derivatives, but, unless primaquine is given, relapses commonly follow. The subsequent recurrence patterns differ, reflecting the elimination kinetics of the partner drugs. Thus, recurrences, presumed to be relapses, occur earlier after artemether + lumefantrine than after dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine or artesunate + mefloquine because lumefantrine is eliminated more rapidly than either mefloquine or piperaquine. A similar temporal pattern of recurrence with each of the drugs is seen in theP. vivaxinfections that follow up to one third of acute falciparum malaria infections in South-East Asia. In areas with chloroquine-resistantP. vivax ACTs containing piperaquine, mefloquine or lumefantrine are the recommended treatment, although artesunate + amodiaquine may also be effective in some areas. In the systematic review of ACTs for treatingP. vivaxmalaria, dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine provided a longer prophylactic effect than ACTs with shorter half-lives (artemether + lumefantrine, artesunate + amodiaquine), with significantly fewer recurrent parasitaemias during 9 weeks of follow-up (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40–0.82, three trials, 1066 participants).

Mixed malaria infections Mixed malaria infections are common in endemic areas. For example, in Thailand, despite low levels of malaria transmission, 8% of patients with acute vivax malaria also haveP. falciparuminfections, and one third of acuteP. falciparuminfections are followed by a presumed relapse of vivax malaria (making vivax malaria the most common complication of falciparum malaria). Mixed infections are best detected by nucleic acid-based amplification techniques, such as PCR; they may be underestimated with routine microscopy. CrypticP. falciparuminfections in vivax malaria can be revealed in approximately 75% of cases by RDTs based on thePfHRP2 antigen, but several RDTs cannot detect mixed infection or have low sensitivity for detecting cryptic vivax malaria. ACTs are effective against all malaria species and so are the treatment of choice for mixed infections.

Certainty of the High evidence Overall certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes: high. Justification GRADE In a systematic review of ACTs for the treatment ofP. vivaxmalaria[252], five trials were conducted in Afghanistan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia and Thailand between 2002 and 2011 with a total of 1622 participants which compared ACTs directly with chloroquine. In comparison with chloroquine: ACTs cleared parasites from the peripheral blood more quickly (parasitaemia after 24 h of treatment: RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.36–0.50, four trials, 1652 participants, high-quality evidence); and ACTs were at least as effective in preventing recurrent parasitaemia before day 28 (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.18–1.90, five trials, 1622 participants, high-quality evidence). In four of these trials, few cases of recurrent parasitaemia were seen before day 28 with both chloroquine and ACTs. In the fifth trial, in Thailand in 2011, increased recurrent parasitaemia was seen after treatment with chloroquine (9%), but was infrequent after ACT (2%) (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09–0.66, one trial, 437 participants). ACT combinations with long half-lives provided a longer prophylactic effect after treatment, with significantly fewer cases of recurrent parasitaemia between day 28 and day 42 or day 63 (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40–0.82, three trials, 1066 participants, moderate-quality evidence). 193 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Other considerations The guideline development group recognized that, in the few settings in whichP. vivaxis the only endemic species and where chloroquine resistance remains low, the increased cost of ACT may not be worth the small additional benefits.

Qualitative tests can discriminate between persons who have G6PD activity < 30% of normal G6PD activity (and are therefore classified as G6PD deficient), and persons who have G6PD activity > 30% of normal (and are classified as non-deficient). In fact, they are almost certainly non-deficient if male, and either non-deficient or with intermediate deficiency if females. Semi-quantitative tests, instead, can classify persons as G6PD normal (≥ 70% G6PD activity), or G6PD deficient (< 30% G6PD activity) or intermediate G6PD deficiency (between 30 and 70% of normal activity). 194 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) No head-to-head comparisons have been done between the accuracy and/or cost-effectiveness of qualitative near patients G6PD tests and semi-quantitative near-patient G6PD tests. The choice between the two depends on available resources, as the semi-quantitative test requires more expensive equipment and trained personnel. However, it must be noted that tafenoquine is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency, if G6PD status is unknown, or if G6PD activity ≤ 70%.Therefore tafenoquine can only be used when the result of a quantitative or a semi-quantitative test is available. See Section 5.2.1.7 anti-relapse treatment ofP. vivaxandP. ovale. Practice Statement Blood stage infection (2024) The G6PD status of patients should be used to guide administration of either primaquine or tafenoquine for preventing relapse. Practical info Please refer toTesting for G6PD deficiency for safe use of primaquine in radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale (Policy brief)[264]andGuide to G6PD deficiency rapid diagnostic testing to support P. vivax radical cure[265]. If G6PD testing is not available, a decision to prescribe or withhold primaquine should be based on the balance of the probability and benefits of preventing relapse against the risks of primaquine-induced haemolytic anaemia. This depends on the population prevalence of G6PD deficiency, the severity of the prevalent genotypes, the daily dose of primaquine and on the capacity of health services to identify and manage primaquine-induced haemolytic reactions. Tafenoquine should not be deployed without accurate G6PD quantitative or semi-quantitative testing and should only be used if patients have ≥ 70% G6PD activity.

Instead, females with G6PD activity in this intermediate range will be classified as normal with a qualitative test. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The main benefits are (1) the prevention of haemolysis in patients who are G6PD deficient, while at the same time providing them with effective treatment; and (2) higher confidence in prescribing the correct treatment by health care professionals. Prevention of haemolysis is the most important desirable effect of implementing G6PD testing, and this was judged to have a large effect based on the sensitivity and specificity of available G6PD tests. Possible harms include (1) potentially more relapses in a small group of patients as false positives will be prescribed a longer course of treatment (8 weekly doses of primaquine) associated with lower adherence to treatment compared to standard (daily doses of) treatment; (2) a false sense of security which causes less attention for potential haemolysis in false negative tested patients; and (3) after confirmation ofP. vivaxinfection a second finger prick is needed to determine the G6PD status. These harms of implementing G6PD testing were considered to have a trivial to small effect based on the sensitivity and specificity of available G6PD tests. 195 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Certainty of the Moderate evidence Diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) The test is considered to be very accurate, with a pooled sensitivity of 94.9% ( 95% CI 89.4, 97.6) and a pooled specificity of 96.2% ( 95% CI 93.5, 97.8).

Furthermore, given the low prevalence of individuals with G6PD activity below 30%, the absolute numbers of false negative test results will always be low to very low (<1% of all negatives). Explanation A sensitivity of 94.9% means that of all patients who are G6PD deficient (i.e. who have a G6PD activity of less than 30% of normal activity based on spectrophotometry), 94.9% will have a qualitative point-of-care test result indicating G6PD deficiency. The remaining 5.1% of the G6PD deficient patients will have a test result indicating that they are not deficient (false negative test result). A specificity of 96.2% means that of all patients who have a G6PD activity above 30% (based on spectrophotometry), 96.2% will have a qualitative point-of-care test result indicating that they are NOT G6PD deficient. This does include patients with intermediate G6PD activity of whom the test indicates that they are not deficient. On the contrary, 3.8% of the patients with a normal or intermediate G6PD activity will have a test result indicating that they are deficient (false positive test result). If a test with these characteristics would be applied to a group of 10,000 patients in which the 5% of patients are G6PD deficient (<30% of normal activity), then this would result in a total of 836 positive test results and thus 836 patients for whom a weekly regimen of primaquine during 8 weeks would be suggested, while 361 of them actually have a normal or intermediate G6PD activity (and 475 will indeed be G6PD deficient). This would also result then in 9164 negative test results and thus 9164 patients who will receive daily doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day primaquine for 14 days or 0.5 mg/kg/day primaquine for 7 days, while 25 of them would actually be G6PD deficient (and 9139 will not be deficient but some of them, especially females, may have intermediate activity). Guidance The practical guidance on the use of qualitative near-patient tests for G6PD deficiency should include all aspects of safe implementation of a new diagnostic test e.g. implementation plan, clear national guidelines, quality assurance and prequalification of tests, training of users, quality assurance of testing, and selection of the type of health services where these tests should be deployed. In addition the guidance should also include specific information on the anti-relapse primaquine treatment regimens linked with a negative (normal) test result, i.e. 0.5 mg/kg/day primaquine for 14 days or 0.5 mg/kg/day primaquine for 7 days, and with positive (deficient) test results, i.e. 0.75 mg/kg weekly doses of primaquine for 8 weeks.

Conclusion We are moderately confident in the estimates of sensitivity and specificity; the true sensitivity and specificity are likely to be close to the estimates of the sensitivity and specificity mentioned here, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. This is because: i) some of the studies on which the summary estimates were based, had a high risk of bias; and ii) the prevalence of G6PD deficiency was different in some study sites or some studies only included one gender (indirectness). See Table “Certainty of the evidence table for near-patients qualitative G6PD tests” under Evidence profiles/ Research evidence. 196 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) We are less certain for other estimates of the evidence of effects on clinical management effects (the links between test results and management decisions), because of the absence of observational studies or availability of modelling studies only. Values and Ministries of health ask for evidence regarding the added value of G6PD testing to inform their preferences decision to implement G6PD testing to prevent haemolysis cases while still being able to treat patients for malaria and prevent relapse. For most outcomes, no or little variation in values may be expected, except maybe people with false positive results, considered G6PD deficient. These will receive the weekly primaquine treatment and may experience lower protection due to poor adherence compared to daily primaquine regimen, while they do not need protection against primaquine-induced haemolysis. Resources The resources required for G6PD qualitative tests are balanced by the benefits of testing. Qualitative tests have relatively low to moderate costs (less than US$ 5), but the cost of setting up diagnostic/ screening test programmes is significant (and separate from using a single test on an individual patient); this would also include indirect costs, such as training. Still, there would be savings because of fewer relapses and less hospitalisations. Equity The impact is likely to be increased equity, as qualitative tests treat males and females similarly. With respect to gender the qualitative test is less accurate than to the semi-quantitative test because it will correctly classify most males (deficient or non-deficient), but it will not separate females with intermediate deficiency from females who are non-deficient. The scoping review of contextual factors did express concerns regarding potential negative effects on equity in remote villages and regarding P. vivaxmalaria, but the committee judged that absence of testing may have larger negative impact on equity than testing (Barker", "page_start": 196, "page_end": 197, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The scoping review of contextual factors did express concerns regarding potential negative effects on equity in remote villages and regarding P. vivaxmalaria, but the committee judged that absence of testing may have larger negative impact on equity than testing (Barker et al.,unpublished evidence). Acceptability The qualitative tests are considered to be probably acceptable to all stakeholders, according to the findings in the scoping review of contextual factors. Feasibility The implementation of qualitative test is considered to be feasible, although there may be settings where there may be barriers to the use of qualitative tests. Justification Although the certainty about the sensitivity of 94.9% (95% CI 89.4, 97.6) and the specificity of 96.2% ( 95% CI 93.5, 97.8) is moderate due to risk of bias and indirectness, the numbers of false negatives (and thus patients with a high risk of haemolysis) are very low: this would consist of 1 to 11 patients in a total of 1000 patients in a situation where the prevalence of G6PD deficiency is 5% or 10% in the whole population. The number of false positives is much higher, but the immediate consequences for this group are less severe. They will receive a longer treatment regimen, i.e. primaquine once weekly for eight weeks instead of once daily for 14 days, with potential risks of non-adherence. However, without testing, the G6PD activity status of malaria patients remains unknown, and may lead to totally refraining from anti-relapse treatment. As this would lead to suboptimal treatment for malaria on a large scale (and many more relapses), we consider that there is a large positive effect of qualitative testing for G6PD deficiency (defined as distinguishing patients with <30% G6PD activity from those with >30 G6PD activity) on choosing the appropriate anti-relapse treatment. Research needs The scoping review on contextual factors showed that there is an evidence need around contextual factors, especially the evidence of the effects of G6PD testing implementation on clinical management and risks of haemolysis (links between test results and treatment decisions) and on equity and human rights issues (Barkeret al.,unpublished evidence).

If only a qualitative near-patient test for G6PD deficiency is available, tafenoquine single dose treatment or high dose primaquine (1mg/kg/day for 7 days) should not be given.

Given the low prevalence of G6PD deficient patients, the absolute numbers of false negative test results will always be low to very low (<1% of all negatives). By pooled 199 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) or individual results, no product included in the systematic review met the TPP requirements at all relevant thresholds when the adjusted male median (AMM) was used to define thresholds of G6PD activity using spectrophotometry (See Table “Summary sensitivity and sensitivity of the semiquantitative tests by threshold as defined by the adjusted male median (AMM)” under Evidence profiles/Research evidence). Therefore, the analysis was done using manufacturer defined thresholds (See Table “Standard G6PD by SD Biosensor – Manufacturer determined thresholds, as per the instructions for use” under Evidence profiles/Research evidence). These were only available for one product, Standard G6PD (SD Biosensor) and yielded results meeting the requirements of sensitivity and specificity stated in the TPP. Explanation At a threshold of 30% of normal G6PD activity: A sensitivity of 100% means that all patients who are G6PD deficient (i.e. who have a G6PD activity of less than 30% of normal G6PD activity based on spectrophotometry) will have a semi-quantitative point-of-care test result indicating G6PD deficiency. None of the G6PD deficient patients will have a test result indicating that they are not deficient (i.e. no false negative test result). A specificity of 97.0% means that of all patients who have a G6PD activity above 30% (based on spectrophotometry), 97% will have a semi-quantitative point-of-care test result indicating that they are NOT G6PD deficient. This does include patients with intermediate G6PD activity of whom the test indicates that they are not deficient. On the contrary, 3% of the patients with a normal or intermediate G6PD activity will have a test result indicating that they are deficient (false positive test result). If a test with these characteristics would be applied in a group of 10 000 patients in which 5% of patients are G6PD deficient (<30% activity), then this would result in a total of 785 positive test results and thus 785 patients for whom a primaquine regimen of 0.75 mg/kg once weekly for 8 weeks would be suggested, while 285 of them actually have a normal or intermediate G6PD activity. This would also result in 9215 negative test results, who will all have indeed normal or intermediate G6PD activity. At a threshold of 70% normal G6PD activity: A sensitivity of 91.4% means that of all patients who are G6PD deficient or have intermediate activity (i.e. who have a G6PD activity of less than 70% based on spectrophotometry), 91.4% will have a semi-quantitative near-patient test result indicating G6PD activity below 70%.

Thus, 8.6% of the G6PD deficient patients or intermediate will have a test result indicating that they are not deficient (false negative test result).

On the contrary, 6.3% of the patients with a normal G6PD activity will have a test result indicating that they are deficient or intermediate (false positive test result). If a test with these characteristics would be applied in a group of 10 000 patients in which 10% of patients have a G6PD activity below 70%, then this would result in a total of 1055 positive test results and thus 1055 patients who would not be eligible to receive tafenoquine or high dose primaquine (1 mg/kg/day for 7 days), while 598 of them actually have a normal G6PD activity. This would also result in 8945 negative test results and thus 8945 patients who are eligible to receive tafenoquine or high dose primaquine (1 mg/kg/day for 7 days), of whom 43 will have intermediate or even deficient G6PD activity. Practical info Although it may be important to know whether a female has an intermediate G6PD activity, programmatically it may not be feasible to tailor the treatments for women differently than for men. Practical guidance should cover all aspects of safe implementation of a new diagnostic test e.g. implementation plan, clear national guidelines, quality assurance/prequalification of tests, training of users, quality assurance of testing, and the type of health care facilities where these tests should be deployed (different levels of health facilities). There will be additional considerations that are specific for semi-quantitative G6PD tests. Programmes may use Standard G6PD test used with STANDARD G6PD Analyzer (by SD Biosensor, Inc) to identify patients with ≥ 70% of normal G6PD activity to safely administer tafenoquine or high dose primaquine anti-relapse treatment (1mg/kg/day for 7 days) and to identify patients with <30% of normal G6PD activity to administer the low dose weekly primaquine regiment (0.75 mg/kg/week for 8 200 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) weeks).

The semi-quantitative tests do provide information about whether a patient has a G6PD activity that falls in the range between 30 and 70. However, the sensitivity to determine whether a woman has a G6PD activity below 70% when an activity below 30% has already been ruled out, is only 52.9% (95% CI 28.8% to 75.7%); so many women with an intermediate activity will be considered “normal” by the semi-quantitative test. On the other hand, the summary specificity is 94.7% (95% CI 86.3% to 98.0%), indicating that only 5.3% of women with “normal” G6PD activity will be told that they have intermediate activity. Depending on endemicity or regional differences, people may value the importance of the risk of relapses differently, the costs of testing (including training and equipment) may vary, and whether the test would indeed influence management and treatment decisions may vary. However, semi- quantitative tests for G6PD deficiency enable optimal malaria treatment while at the same time limiting the risk of haemolysis. Conclusion We are highly confident in the estimates of sensitivity and specificity for the threshold of 30%; the true sensitivity and specificity are very likely to be close to the estimates of the sensitivity and specificity mentioned here. See Table “Certainty of the evidence table for STANDARD G6PD Test (SD BIOSENSOR, Inc): threshold 30%” under Evidence profiles/Research evidence. We are moderately confident in the estimates of sensitivity and specificity for a threshold of 70%; the true sensitivity and specificity are likely to be close to the estimates of the sensitivity and specificity mentioned here, but there is a possibility that especially the sensitivity may be substantially different. This is because the estimates of sensitivity had very wide confidence intervals. See Table “Certainty of the evidence table for STANDARD G6PD Test a (SD BIOSENSOR, Inc): threshold 70%” under Evidence profiles/Research evidence. We are less certain for other estimates of the evidence of test’s effects and the evidence of effects on clinical management (the links between test results and management decisions), because of the absence of observational no studies or availability of modelling studies only.

Values and The contextual factors review included 10 studies on values, mainly for quantitative tests. These preferences studies found that there is a variation between health care workers in how they value the outcomes of interest (true and false positive and negative test results plus the subsequent consequences thereof). Still, governments ask for evidence regarding the value of G6PD testing as a way to prevent haemolysis cases while still being able to treat patients for malaria. For most outcomes, no or little variation in values may be excepted for the false positives, considered G6PD deficient. These will receive an effective weekly primaquine treatment with lower protection from relapses due to lower adherence to treatment compared to the daily regimens of primaquine, while they do not need protection against risk of haemolysis induced by primaquine. Resources The cost of the required analyzer device is probably the biggest differentiator between the cost for implementation of qualitative and semi-quantitative costs, since the semi quantitative has a big initial cost (but cost may be decreased if more persons are being tested). Furthermore, resources are needed to train personnel, and to maintain the test kits and readers; and there may be other logistic costs. On this basis, the resources required were considered to be moderate. There would also be savings because of fewer relapses and fewer haemolysis and less hospitalizations. Although limited research has been conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness of near-patient semi-quantitative 201 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) G6PD tests, the available results suggest a high likelihood that these tests could be cost-effective and potentially cost saving depending on the setting. Equity In situations with very fewP. vivaxorP. ovalemalaria cases and hard to reach areas with limited resources, the initial cost of the device may be a barrier and may thus decrease equity. But insofar as testing allows overall more effective treatment for malaria, there will tend to be an overall positive effect on equity, given the skewed distribution of malaria (towards low income population groups) worldwide. Acceptability The semi-quantitative tests are considered probably acceptable, according to the findings of the scoping review of contextual factors (Barker et al.,unpublished reference). Feasibility The implementation of semi-quantitative test is considered to be feasible to implement, although there may be settings where there may be barriers to the use of qualitative tests.

Justification Although the certainty about the sensitivity at the threshold of 70% is moderate due to imprecision, the numbers of false negatives will mainly include patients whose G6PD activity will be slightly less than 70% (and thus patients with a lower risk of haemolysis than those with a G6PD activity of <30%). Without testing, the G6PD activity status of malaria patients remains unknown, which may lead to totally refraining from anti- relapse treatment at all. As this would lead to suboptimal treatment for malaria on a large scale (and many more relapses), we consider that there is a large positive effect of semi-quantitative testing for G6PD deficiency (defined as <30% G6PD activity) on choosing the right treatment to be large. In addition, it will be particularly important to determine the G6PD status for females since those with intermediate activity of G6PD (30–70%) will have a higher risk of haemolysis than patients who have a G6PD activity above 70%. Research needs The scoping review on contextual factors showed that there is an evidence need around contextual factors, especially for the evidence of the effects of G6PD testing implementation on haemolysis, effects and clinical management (the links between test results and management decisions) and equity and human rights issues. More evidence may be needed to provide a higher certainty of the diagnostic accuracy evidence of all near-patient semi- quantitative G6PD tests available for all three categories of G6PD activity: deficiency, intermediate, and normal G6PD activity. More evidence may be need on the cost-effectiveness and potential cost-saving achievable through the use of semi- quantitative versus qualitative G6PD tests. 5.2.1.7 Anti-relapse treatment of P. vivax and P. ovale 202 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Tafenoquine as anti-relapse therapy (2024) Tafenoquine is recommended as an alternative to primaquine (3.5 mg/kg total dose) for preventing relapses ofP. vivaxin patients ≥ 2years of age, who have ≥ 70% G6PD activity and who receive chloroquine treatment. - These recommendations pertain only to South America. - Quantitative or semi-quantitative determination of G6PD activity must be done before tafenoquine administration. - Tafenoquine is not recommended in pregnant and lactating women. - Tafenoquine is not recommended in patients receiving artemisinin-based combination therapies for the treatment ofP. vivax. - Controlled deployment and /or further research is encouraged outside of South America, to generate evidence of the efficacy and safety of tafenoquine compared to primaquine as an anti-relapse treatment. - No data is available comparing tafenoquine with primaquine given at a total dose of 7.0 mg/kg.

Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Tafenoquine is probably as effective as primaquine (3.5 mg/kg total dose) forP. vivaxrelapse prevention up to 6 months. The 3.5 mg/kg total primaquine dose is given as either 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days or 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days; the two regimens have similar efficacy and safety. Tafenoquine + chloroquine probably has little or no difference in adverse events (any type) compared to primaquine (3.5 mg/kg total dose) + chloroquine. Although there was a slightly greater drop in haemoglobin with tafenoquine + chloroquine compared to primaquine + chloroquine, the overall balance between benefit and harm does not seem to favor either tafenoquine or primaquine[267]. The recommendation is only presently applicable to South America as the evidence on efficacy and safety is mainly from studies in South America (contributing to over 75% of the sample size data). Also, tafenoquine comparison was only with primaquine given at the total dose of 3.5 mg/kg. No data is available on the comparison of tafenoquine with the currently recommended higher primaquine total dose of 7.0 mg/kg. Limited data from South-East Asia indicates that chloroquine with primaquine (3.5 mg/kg) performed better in preventing relapses than chloroquine with tafenoquine[268]. This finding seems to imply that the response to tafenoquine, as compared to primaquine, may vary in different regions. More evidence on the safety and efficacy of tafenoquine is required for other regions, also in comparison to the currently recommended higher dose of primaquine (7.0 mg/kg total dose). Tafenoquine should not be deployed without accurate G6PD quantitative or semi-quantitative testing and should only be used if patients have ≥70% G6PD activity. 203 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Certainty of the Low evidence Though the certainty of the evidence was moderate for the efficacy outcome of parasitaemia during the six months of follow-up, the overall certainty of the evidence was rated low because of the serious imprecision regarding serious adverse events.

Values and The values were considered relatively homogeneous, i.e., there was probably no important preferences uncertainty or variability. It is difficult to assess how different populations would value benefits versus a potentially serious adverse reactions, but considerations of preferences and values do not favour either tafenoquine or primaquine. Resources Presently, the cost of tafenoquine and a full course of primaquine are approximately the same. However, the deployment of tafenoquine would entail greater resource requirements, resulting in larger costs. This higher cost is due to the requirement for quantitative or semi-quantitative determination of G6PD activity to safely administer tafenoquine as against the requirement of a qualitative test to safely administer primaquine at 3.5 mg/kg. The cost to quantitatively or semi- quantitatively measure G6PD activity (including the analyser and the test strips) is high. However, the available economic evaluations showed that tafenoquine prescribed after semi-quantitative G6PD testing is highly likely to be cost-effective in Brazil, considering a willingness to pay threshold of US$ 7800 adopted by the Brazilian National Commission for the Incorporation of Technologies (CONITEC), considered the maximum value that an intervention should cost per DALY averted to be considered cost-effective[269]. Equity There is a theoretical risk for reduced health equity since all patients with G6PD activity below 70% of normal would be excluded from receiving tafenoquine. However, this risk is mitigated by the availability of primaquine, which remains an option for anti-relapse treatment for these patients. It is expected that all countries that deploying tafenoquine will also need to continue to deploy primaquine as an anti-relapse medicine. Feasibility The introduction of tafenoquine as an alternative drug is probably feasible. The evidence from a study in Brazil showed that 99·7% (95% CI 99·4 to 99·8) of patients with P. vivax monoinfection aged ≥16 years were treated or not treated with tafenoquine in accordance with G6PD activity assessed by point-of-care quantitative tests[270]. This result was consistent across all health facilities. Across all patients who received tafenoquine, 97·7% (95%CI 97·0 to 98·2; 2623/2685) were treated according to the treatment algorithm. Chloroquine was administered to 99·9% (2682/2685) of patients with tafenoquine. Forty-nine patients presented with mixed infection, and all five who received tafenoquine were G6PD normal. The study showed that mistakes in administration were more likely to be associated with prescribing errors rather than errors in the quantitative G6PD test.

Whether a high dose of primaquine 7 mg/kg is given in 14 days or 7 days, the absolute benefit of using the high primaquine total dose will vary according to the risk of recurrence in the population. The benefits are higher in Africa, South-East Asia and Oceania. However, in areas on the Indian subcontinent and in the Americas, where the absolute benefit of a total high dose of 7 mg/kg might be only marginally greater than that of 3.5 mg/kg, primaquine at a low 3.5 mg/kg total dose might be used. - It should be emphasized that determination of G6PD status using appropriate test is needed to guide the safe administration of primaquine (see section 5.2.1.6 on G6PD testing). Practical info 1. It is appreciated that national decisions regarding the choice of high dose PQ regimens (7.0 mg/kg total dose given at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days or 7.0 mg/kg total dose given as 1 mg/kg/day for 7 days) as against the low dose PQ regimen (3.5 mg/ kg total dose given at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days) will depend on the risk-benefit analysis depending on localP. vivaxrelapse rate, the availability of different types of G6PD tests, and capacity for supervised therapy.

It should be emphasized that G6PD testing is needed prior to primaquine administration. 4. Primaquine can be given except for pregnant women, infants < 1 months of age and women breastfeeding infants < 1 months of age. Secretion of primaquine in breast milk is negligible[229]. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review showed moderate benefit and small undesirable effects, probably favoring primaquine at a high total dose of 7.0 mg/kg over primaquine at a low total dose of 3.5 mg/kg[308]. There may be a moderate to large reduction inP. vivaxrecurrences with 7 mg/kg total dose primaquine compared with 3.5 mg/kg total dose primaquine (moderate certainty of evidence across all patient groups, moderate certainty of evidence in children <5 years). However, the evidence is uncertain about the effect of 7 mg/kg total dose primaquine compared with 3.5 mg/kg total dose primaquine in the Americas and South Asia (very low certainty of evidence)[309]. Adverse events did not increase in patients treated with 14 days of primaquine at 0.5 mg/kg/day (7 mg/kg) compared with 7 days of primaquine at 0.5 mg/kg/day (3.5 mg/kg). Clinically relevant haemolysis is rare. However, the daily dose rather than the total dose of primaquine has a significant effect on the risk of clinically relevant haemolysis and gastrointestinal intolerance. In patients with intermediate G6PD activity (30-<70%) there may be a significant increase in the risk of clinically relevant haemolysis (>25% fall to Hb <7 g/dL) in those treated with 1 mg/kg/day primaquine for 7 days compared with 0.25 mg/kg/day primaquine for 14 days (low certainty of evidence), while in patients with 70% G6PD there may be a very small to no increase in the risk of clinically relevant haemolysis (very low certainty of evidence). Gastrointestinal intolerance may be increased at days 5-7 in people receiving 1mg/kg/day primaquine for 7 days compared with 0.25 mg/kg/day primaquine for 14 days (very low certainty of evidence). 205 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Certainty of the Moderate evidence Although the evidence summary for the different outcomes showed variable certainty of evidence (efficacy: high to very low, undesirable outcomes: low to very low), the panel decided to give more weight to the certainty of evidence for moderate efficacy outcome.

Whether a high dose of primaquine 7 mg/kg is given over 14 days or 7 days, the absolute benefit of increasing the total dose will vary according to the risk of recurrence in a population. There may be a variation in preferences in different settings depending on how national programmes value the impact of shorter regimens which may lead to improved adherence and effectiveness[310]. The risk of clinically relevant haemolysis will vary according to the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the population and the ability to test for G6PD deficiency. It was noted that the evidence for this recommendation was based on clinical trial settings with close supervision of administration of the treatment options. This might have an impact on how outcomes will be valued in different settings. Resources There is low certainty on whether there will be negligible costs and savings because costs of required resources may vary geographically. There will be an increased cost for higher primaquine dosing given that the dose is doubled. Prescriber training and end-user information will be needed to improve prescribing, compliance and adverse event awareness. The primaquine high dose regimen of 7 mg/kg total dose given as 1 mg/ kg/day for 7 days requires a semi-quantitative G6PD assay to target treatment to patients who have ≥70% G6PD activity and the cost for the test and analyzer needs to be added to the costing for resources. The need for follow-up and management of adverse events should also be considered. On the other hand, a reduction in the risk of recurrence will lead to reduced direct and indirect costs on the healthcare system and reduced household costs. Evidence coming from cost evaluation studies showed that high dose primaquine is probably favored over low dose primaquine. A global cost-effectiveness analysis, undertaken prior to the updated evidence for the efficacy of high dose compared with low dose primaquine, assessed the cost of implementing high dose primaquine over 14 days after assessing G6PD activity using a point of care test to identify individuals with <30% and >30% G6PD activity. The study concluded that a substantial global economic burden of vivax malaria could be reduced through investment in safe and effective radical cure achieved by routine screening for G6PD deficiency and supervised treatment[274]. Equity The panel assessed that the proposed intervention of high-dose primaquine probably will have no impact on equity, although it may vary across different populations. Enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing relapses will probably increase equity, as the burden of relapses is disproportionately higher in populations with reduced resources.

There might be a possibility of reduced equity if poorer populations have limited access to G6PD testing prior to therapy. Heterozygous female patients with intermediate G6PD activity (30-<70%) may have an increased risk of adverse events from a high dose 7-day primaquine regimen[312]. Acceptability Acceptability could vary because of the variability in the effectiveness and risk for adverse events in different populations. In populations using a 14-day primaquine dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day, the improved efficacy associated with increasing the dose of primaquine from 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg/day may support acceptability from the perspective of patients and their carers. However, the increased pill burden also needs to be considered. From a healthcare provider perspective, the increased importance of G6PD testing and local pharmacovigilance systems may decrease acceptability. 206 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) In populations using a 7-day primaquine dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day, the improved efficacy of a 14-day dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day may support acceptability from the perspective of patients and healthcare providers. However, reduced acceptability of a longer duration will likely be important in some populations. In populations using a 7-day primaquine regimen of 1 mg/kg/day, the improved efficacy in most populations and short duration of treatment will increase the acceptability for most users. However, this may be countered by the increased pill burden associated with a higher daily dose. Reduced gastrointestinal tolerability of the 1 mg/kg/day dose may reduce acceptability, although this may be mitigated by intake with food. The local availability of G6PD semiquantitative testing and local pharmacovigilance systems may impact the acceptability for some implementers to change policy, especially given the potential for increased haemolysis in individuals with 30–<70% G6PD activity with a 7-day 1 mg/kg/day primaquine regimen. Community engagement and education of healthcare workers, patients and their carers may enhance acceptability and ensure awareness of early indicators of adverse effects. The decision regarding total dose may impact the duration of therapy or the decision to implement specific types of the G6PD testing.

Implementation of high total dose primaquine over 14 days or 7 days will be feasible in settings where G6PD testing is available and/or pharmacovigilance is in place.

Conditional recommendation for , Very low certainty evidence Preventing relapse in people with G6PD deficiency (2015) In people with G6PD deficiency, primaquine base at 0.75 mg/kg bw once a week for 8 weeks can be given to prevent relapse, with close medical supervision for potential primaquine-induced haemolysis. Practical info - In patients known to be G6PD deficient, primaquine may be considered at a dose of 0.75 mg base/kg bw once a week for 8 weeks. The decision to give or withhold primaquine should depend on the possibility of giving the treatment under close medical supervision, with ready access to health facilities with blood transfusion services. - Some heterozygote females who test as normal or not deficient in qualitative G6PD screening tests have intermediate G6PD activity and can still haemolyse substantially. Intermediate deficiency (30–70% of normal) and normal enzyme activity (> 70% of normal) can be differentiated only with a quantitative or semiquantitative G6PD test. In the absence of quantitative testing, all females should be considered as potentially having intermediate G6PD activity and given the 14-day regimen of primaquine, with counselling on how to recognize symptoms and signs of haemolytic anaemia. They should be advised to stop primaquine and be told where to seek care should these signs develop. - If G6PD testing is not available, a decision to prescribe or withhold primaquine should be based on the balance of the probability and benefits of preventing relapse against the risks of primaquine-induced haemolytic anaemia. This depends on the population prevalence of G6PD deficiency, the severity of the prevalent genotypes and on the capacity of health services to identify and manage primaquine-induced haemolytic reactions. 207 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Desirable effects: - There are no comparative trials of the efficacy or safety of primaquine in people with G6PD deficiency.

Justification GRADE In a systematic review of primaquine for radical cure ofP. vivaxmalaria[276], 14 days of primaquine was compared with placebo or no treatment in 10 trials, and 14 days was compared with 7 days in one trial. The trials were conducted in Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan and Thailand between 1992 and 2006. In comparison with placebo or no primaquine: 14 days of primaquine (0.25 mg/kg bw per day) reduced relapses during 15 months of follow-up by about 40% (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.48–0.75, 10 trials, 1740 participants, high-quality evidence). In comparison with 7 days of primaquine: 14 days of primaquine (0.25 mg/kg bw per day) reduced relapses during 6 months of follow-up by over 50% (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25–0.81, one trial, 126 participants, low-quality evidence). No direct comparison has been made of higher doses (0.5 mg/kg bw for 14 days) with the standard regimen (0.25 mg/kg bw for 14 days). Twelve of the 15 trials included in the review explicitly excluded people with G6PD deficiency; the remaining three did not report on this aspect. No serious adverse events were reported. Other considerations In the absence of evidence to recommend alternatives, the guideline development group considers 0.75 mg/kg bw primaquine given once weekly for 8 weeks to be the safest regimen for people with G6PD deficiency. Primaquine and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Any person (male or female) with red cell G6PD activity < 30% of the normal mean has G6PD deficiency and will experience haemolysis after primaquine. Heterozygote females with higher mean red cell activities may still show substantial haemolysis. G6PD deficiency is an inherited sex-linked genetic disorder, which is associated with some protection againstP. falciparum andP. vivaxmalaria but increased susceptibility to oxidant haemolysis. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency varies, but in tropical areas it is typically 3–35%; high frequencies are found only in areas where malaria is or has been endemic. There are many (> 180) different G6PD deficiency genetic variants; nearly all of which make the red cells susceptible to oxidant haemolysis, but the severity of haemolysis may vary. Primaquine generates reactive intermediate metabolites that are oxidant and cause variable haemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. It also causes methemoglobinaemia. The severity of haemolytic anaemia depends on the dose of primaquine and on the variant of the G6PD enzyme. Fortunately, primaquine is eliminated rapidly so haemolysis is self-limiting once the drug is stopped. In the absence of exposure to primaquine or another oxidant agent, G6PD deficiency rarely causes clinical manifestations so, many patients are unaware of their G6PD status. 208 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Remarks Primaquine is contraindicated in pregnancy and women breastfeeding infants aged < 1 month.

Practice Statement Preventing relapse inP. vivaxorP. ovalemalaria (2015) When G6PD status is unknown and G6PD testing is not available, a decision to prescribe primaquine should be based on an assessment of the risks and benefits of adding primaquine. Justification If G6PD testing is not available, a decision to prescribe or withhold primaquine should be based on the balance of the probability and benefits of preventing relapse against the risks of primaquine-induced haemolytic anaemia. This depends on the population prevalence of G6PD deficiency, the severity of the prevalent genotypes and on the capacity of health services to identify and manage primaquine-induced haemolytic reactions. Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Pregnant and breastfeeding women (2015) In women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, weekly chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine can be given until delivery and breastfeeding are completed, then, on the basis of G6PD status, primaquine can be given to prevent future relapse. Practical info Primaquine is contraindicated in pregnancy and women breastfeeding infants aged < 1 month. As an alternative, chloroquine prophylaxis could be given to suppress relapses after acute vivax malaria during pregnancy. Once the infant has been delivered and the mother has completed breastfeeding, primaquine could then be given to achieve radical cure. Few data are available on the safety of primaquine in infancy, and in the past primaquine was not recommended for infants. There is, however, no specific reason why primaquine should not be given to children aged 6 months to 1 year (provided they do not have G6PD deficiency), as this age group may suffer multiple relapses from vivax malaria. The guideline development group therefore recommended lowering the age restriction to 6 months.

Therefore, consider weekly chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine until delivery and breastfeeding are completed, then treat with 14 days of primaquine to prevent future relapse. 5.2.2 Treating severe malaria Mortality from untreated severe malaria (particularly cerebral malaria) approaches 100%. With prompt, effective antimalarial treatment and supportive care, the rate falls to 10–20% overall. Within the broad definition of severe malaria some syndromes are associated with lower mortality rates (e.g. severe anaemia) and others with higher mortality rates (e.g. acidosis). The risk for death increases in the presence of multiple complications. Any patient with malaria who is unable to take oral medications reliably, shows any evidence of vital organ dysfunction or has a high parasite count is at increased risk for dying. The exact risk depends on the species of infecting malaria parasite, the number of systems affected, the degree of vital organ dysfunction, age, background immunity, pre-morbid, and concomitant diseases, and access to appropriate treatment. Tests such as a parasite count, haematocrit and blood glucose may all be performed immediately at the point of care, but the results of other laboratory measures, if any, may be available only after hours or days. As severe malaria is potentially fatal, any patient considered to be at increased risk should be given the benefit of the highest level of care available. The attending clinician should not worry unduly about definitions: the severely ill patient requires immediate supportive care, and, if severe malaria is a possibility, parenteral antimalarial drug treatment should be started without delay. Definitions Severe falciparum malaria: For epidemiological purposes, severe falciparum malariais defined as one or more of the following, occurring in the absence of an identified alternative cause and in the presence ofP. falciparumasexual parasitaemia. - Impaired consciousness: A Glasgow coma score < 11 in adults or a Blantyre coma score < 3 in children - Prostration: Generalized weakness so that the person is unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance - Multiple convulsions: More than two episodes within 24 h - Acidosis: A base deficit of > 8 mEq/L or, if not available, a plasma bicarbonate level of < 15 mmol/L or venous plasma lactate ≥ 5 mmol/L. Severe acidosis manifests clinically as respiratory distress (rapid, deep, laboured breathing). - Hypoglycaemia: Blood or plasma glucose < 2.2 mmol/L (< 40 mg/dL) - Severe malarial anaemia: Haemoglobin concentration ≤ 5 g/dL or a haematocrit of ≤ 15% in children < 12 years of age (< 7 g/ dL and < 20%, respectively, in adults) with a parasite count > 10 000/μL", "page_start": 210, "page_end": 210, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Secondary objectives are prevention of disabilities and prevention of recrudescent infection. Death from severe malaria often occurs within hours of admission to a hospital or clinic, so it is essential that therapeutic concentrations of a highly effective antimalarial drug be achieved as soon as possible. Management of severe malaria comprises mainly clinical assessment of the patient, specific antimalarial treatment, additional treatment and supportive care. Clinical assessment Severe malaria is a medical emergency. An open airway should be secured in unconscious patients and breathing and circulation assessed. The patient should be weighed or body weight estimated, so that medicines, including antimalarial drugs and fluids, can be given appropriately. An intravenous cannula should be inserted, and blood glucose (rapid test), haematocrit or haemoglobin, parasitaemia and, in adults, renal function should be measured immediately. A detailed clinical examination should be conducted, including a record of the coma score. Several coma scores have been advocated: the Glasgow coma scale is suitable for adults, and the simple Blantyre modification is easily performed in children. Unconscious patients should undergo a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis to exclude bacterial meningitis.

Unconscious patients should undergo a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis to exclude bacterial meningitis. The degree of acidosis is an important determinant of outcome; the plasma bicarbonate or venous lactate concentration should be measured, if possible. If facilities are available, arterial or capillary blood pH and gases should be measured in patients who are unconscious, hyperventilating or in shock. Blood should be taken for cross-matching, a full blood count, a platelet count, clotting studies, blood culture and full biochemistry (if possible). Careful attention should be paid to the patient’s fluid balance in severe malaria in order to avoid over- or under-hydration. Individual requirements vary widely and depend on fluid losses before admission. The differential diagnosis of fever in a severely ill patient is broad. Coma and fever may be due to meningoencephalitis or malaria. Cerebral malaria is not associated with signs of meningeal irritation (neck stiffness, photophobia or Kernig’s sign), but the patient may be opisthotonic. As untreated bacterial meningitis is almost invariably fatal, a diagnostic lumbar puncture should be performed to exclude this condition. There is also considerable clinical overlap between septicaemia, pneumonia and severe malaria, and these conditions may coexist. When possible, blood should always be taken on admission for bacterial culture. In malaria-endemic areas, particularly where parasitaemia is common in young age groups, it is difficult to rule out septicaemia immediately in a shocked or severely ill obtunded child.In all such cases, empirical parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately, together with antimalarial treatment. Treatment of severe malaria It is essential that full doses of effective parenteral (or rectal) antimalarial treatment be given promptly in the initial treatment of severe malaria. This should be followed by a full dose of effective ACT orally. Two classes of medicine are available for parenteral treatment of severe malaria: artemisinin derivatives (artesunate or artemether) and the cinchona alkaloids (quinine and quinidine). Parenteral artesunate is the treatment of choice for all severe malaria. The largest randomized clinical trials ever conducted on severe falciparum malaria showed a substantial reduction in mortality with intravenous or intramuscular artesunate as compared with parenteral quinine. The reduction in mortality was not associated with an increase in neurological sequelae in artesunate- treated survivors. Furthermore, artesunate is simpler and safer to use. Pre-referral treatment options See recommendation. Adjustment of parenteral dosing in renal failure or hepatic dysfunction The dosage of artemisinin derivatives does not have to be adjusted for patients with vital organ dysfunction.

However quinine accumulates in severe vital organ dysfunction. If a patient with severe malaria has persisting acute kidney injury or there is no clinical improvement by 48 h, the dose of quinine should be reduced by one third, to 10 mg salt/kg bw every 12 h. Dosage adjustments are not necessary if patients are receiving either haemodialysis or haemofiltration. Follow-on treatment The current recommendation of experts is to give parenteral antimalarial drugs for the treatment of severe malaria for a minimum of 24 h once started (irrespective of the patient’s ability to tolerate oral medication earlier) or until the patient can tolerate oral medication, before giving the oral follow-up treatment. After initial parenteral treatment, once the patient can tolerate oral therapy, it is essential to continue and complete treatment with an effective oral antimalarial drug by giving a full course of effective ACT (artesunate + amodiaquine, artemether + lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine). If the patient presented initially with impaired consciousness, ACTs containing mefloquine should be avoided because of an increased incidence of neuropsychiatric complications. When an ACT is not available, artesunate + clindamycin, artesunate + doxycycline, quinine + clindamycin or quinine + doxycycline can be used for follow-on 211 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) treatment. Doxycycline is preferred to other tetracyclines because it can be given once daily and does not accumulate in cases of renal failure, but it should not be given to children < 8 years or pregnant women. As treatment with doxycycline is begun only when the patient has recovered sufficiently, the 7-day doxycycline course finishes after the artesunate, artemether or quinine course. When available, clindamycin may be substituted in children and pregnant women. Continuing supportive care Patients with severe malaria require intensive nursing care, preferably in an intensive care unit where possible. Clinical observations should be made as frequently as possible and should include monitoring of vital signs, coma score and urine output. Blood glucose should be monitored every 4 h, if possible, particularly in unconscious patients. Management of complications Severe malaria is associated with a variety of manifestations and complications, which must be recognized promptly and treated as shown below.

Adults with severe malaria are very vulnerable to fluid overload, while children are more likely to be dehydrated. The fluid regimen must also be adapted to the infusion of antimalarial drugs. Rapid bolus infusion of colloid or crystalloids is contraindicated. If available, haemofiltration should be started early for acute kidney injury or severe metabolic acidosis, which do not respond to rehydration. As the degree of fluid depletion varies considerably in patients with severe malaria, it is not possible to give general recommendations on fluid replacement; each patient must be assessed individually and fluid resuscitation based on the estimated deficit. In high-transmission settings, children commonly present with severe anaemia and hyperventilation (sometimes termed “respiratory distress”) resulting from severe metabolic acidosis and anaemia; they should be treated by blood transfusion. In adults, there is a very thin dividing line between over-hydration, which may produce pulmonary oedema, and under-hydration, which contributes to shock, worsening acidosis and renal impairment. Careful, frequent evaluation of jugular venous pressure, peripheral perfusion, venous filling, skin turgor and urine output should be made. Blood transfusion Severe malaria is associated with rapid development of anaemia, as infected, once infected and uninfected erythrocytes are haemolysed and/or removed from the circulation by the spleen. Ideally, fresh, cross-matched blood should be transfused; however, in most settings, cross-matched virus-free blood is in short supply.

Ideally, fresh, cross-matched blood should be transfused; however, in most settings, cross-matched virus-free blood is in short supply. As for fluid resuscitation, there are not enough studies to make strong evidence-based recommendations on the indications for transfusion; the recommendations given here are based on expert opinion. In high-transmission settings, blood transfusion is generally recommended for children with a haemoglobin level of < 5 g/ 100 mL (haematocrit < 15%). In low-transmission settings, a threshold of 20% (haemoglobin, 7 g/100 mL) is recommended. These general recommendations must, however, be adapted to the individual, as the pathological consequences of rapid development of anaemia are worse than those of chronic or acute anaemia when there has been adaptation and a compensatory right shift in the oxygen dissociation curve. Exchange blood transfusion Many anecdotal reports and several series have claimed the benefit of exchange blood transfusion in severe malaria, but there have been no comparative trials, and there is no consensus on whether it reduces mortality or how it might work. Various rationales have been proposed: - removing infected red blood cells from the circulation and therefore lowering the parasite burden (although only the circulating, relatively non-pathogenic stages are removed, and this is also achieved rapidly with artemisinin derivatives); - rapidly reducing both the antigen load and the burden of parasite-derived toxins, metabolites and toxic mediators produced by the host; and - replacing the rigid unparasitized red cells by more easily deformable cells, therefore alleviating microcirculatory obstruction. Exchange blood transfusion requires intensive nursing care and a relatively large volume of blood, and it carries significant risks. There is no consensus on the indications, benefits and dangers involved or on practical details such as the volume of blood that should be exchanged. It is, therefore, not possible to make any recommendation regarding the use of exchange blood transfusion. Concomitant use of antibiotics The threshold for administering antibiotic treatment should be low in severe malaria. Septicaemia and severe malaria are associated, and there is substantial diagnostic overlap,particularly in children in areas of moderate and high transmission.Thus broad- spectrum antibiotic treatmentshouldbe givenwith antimalarial drugs to all children with suspected severe malaria in areas of moderate and high transmission until a bacterial infection is excluded. After the start of antimalarial treatment, unexplained deterioration may result from a supervening bacterial infection.Enteric bacteria (notablySalmonella) predominated in many trial series in Africa, but a variety of bacteria have been cultured from the blood of patients with a diagnosis of severe malaria. Patients with secondary pneumonia or with clear evidence of aspiration should be given empirical treatment with an appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic.

In the majority of 213 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) cases of persistent fever, however, no other pathogen is identified after parasite clearance. Antibiotic treatment should be based on culture and sensitivity results or,if not available, local antibiotic sensitivity patterns. Use of anticonvulsants The treatment of convulsions in cerebral malaria with intravenous (or, if this is not possible, rectal) benzodiazepines or intramuscular paraldehyde is similar to that for repeated seizures from any cause. In a large, double-blind, placebo- controlled evaluation of a single prophylactic intramuscular injection of 20 mg/kg bw of phenobarbital to children with cerebral malaria, the frequency of seizures was reduced but the mortality rate was increased significantly. This resulted from respiratory arrest and was associated with additional use of benzodiazepine. A 20 mg/kg bw dose of phenobarbital should notbe given without respiratory support. It is not known whether a lower dose would be effective and safer or whether mortality would not increase if ventilation were given. In the absence of further information, prophylactic anticonvulsants are not recommended. Treatments that are not recommended In an attempt to reduce the high mortality from severe malaria, various adjunctive treatments have been evaluated, but none has proved effective and many have been shown to be harmful. Heparin, prostacyclin, desferroxamine, pentoxifylline, low- molecular- mass dextran, urea, high-dose corticosteroids, aspirin anti-TNF antibody, cyclosporine A,dichloroacetate, adrenaline, hyperimmune serum,N-acetylcysteine and bolus administration of albumin are not recommended.In addition,use of corticosteroids increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and seizures and has been associated with prolonged coma resolution times when compared with placebo. Treatment of severe malaria during pregnancy Women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy are more likely to have severe malaria than other adults, and, in low- transmission settings, this is often complicated by pulmonary oedema and hypoglycaemia. Maternal mortality is approximately 50%, which is higher than in non-pregnant adults. Fetal death and premature labour are common. Parenteral antimalarial drugs should be given to pregnant women with severe malaria in full doses without delay. Parenteral artesunate is the treatment of choice in all trimesters.Treatment must not be delayed. If artesunate is unavailable, intramuscular artemether should be given, and if this is unavailable then parenteral quinine should be started immediately until artesunate is obtained.

Postpartum bacterial infection is a common complication and should be managed appropriately. Treatment of severeP. vivaxmalaria AlthoughP. vivaxmalaria is considered to be benign, with a low case-fatality rate, it may cause a debilitating febrile illness with progressive anaemia and can also occasionally cause severe disease, as inP. falciparummalaria. Reported manifestations of severeP. vivaxmalaria include severe anaemia, thrombocytopenia, acute pulmonary oedema and, less commonly, cerebral malaria, pancytopenia, jaundice, splenic rupture, haemoglobinuria, acute renal failure and shock. Prompt effective treatment and case management should be the same as for severeP. falciparummalaria (see section 5.5.1). Following parenteral artesunate, treatment can be completed with a full treatment course of oral ACT or chloroquine (in countries where chloroquine is the treatment of choice). A full course of radical treatment with primaquine should be given after recovery. Please refer toManagement of severe malaria - A practical handbook, 3rd edition[288]. 5.2.2.1 Artesunate Strong recommendation for , High certainty evidence Treating severe malaria (2015) Adults and children with severe malaria (including infants, pregnant women in all trimesters and lactating women) should be treated with intravenous or intramuscular artesunate for at least 24 h and until they can tolerate oral medication. Once a patient has received at least 24 h of parenteral therapy and can tolerate oral therapy, treatment should be completed with 3 days of an ACT. 214 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Practical info Artesunate is dispensed as a powder of artesunic acid, which is dissolved in sodium bicarbonate (5%) to form sodium artesunate. The solution is then diluted in approximately 5 mL of 5% dextrose and given by intravenous injection or by intramuscular injection into the anterior thigh. The solution should be prepared freshly for each administration and should not be stored. Artesunate is rapidly hydrolysed in- vivo to dihydroartemisinin, which provides the main antimalarial effect. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of parenteral artesunate in children with severe malaria suggest that they have less exposure than older children and adults to both artesunate and the biologically active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. Body weight has been identified as a significant covariate in studies of the pharmacokinetics of orally and rectally administered artesunate, which suggests that young children have a larger apparent volume of distribution for both compounds and should therefore receive a slightly higher dose of parenteral artesunate to achieve exposure comparable to that of older children and adults.

In a prospective study involving African children, the same phenomenon was reported in 5 (7%) of the 72 hyperparasitaemic children studied. Artesunate rapidly kills ring-stage parasites, which are then taken out of the red cells by the spleen; these infected erythrocytes are then returned to the circulation but with a shortened life span, resulting in the observed haemolysis. Thus, post-treatment haemolysis is a predictable event related to the life-saving effect of artesunate. Hyperparasitaemic patients must be followed up carefully to identify late-onset anaemia. Please refer to theInformation note on delayed haemolytic anaemia following treatment with artesunate[280]. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Desirable effects: - In both adults and children, parenteral artesunate prevented more deaths than parenteral quinine (high-quality evidence). - For intravenous administration, artesunate is given as a bolus, whereas quinine requires slow infusion. - For intramuscular administration, artesunate is given in a smaller volume than quinine. Undesirable effects: - Artesunate is associated with a small increase in neurological sequelae at the time of hospital discharge (moderate-quality evidence). The difference is no longer evident on day 28 after discharge (moderate-quality evidence). Certainty of the High evidence Overall certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes: high. Justification GRADE In a systematic review of artesunate for severe malaria[281], eight randomized controlled trials with a total of 1664 adults and 5765 children, directly compared parenteral artesunate with parenteral quinine. The trials were conducted in various African and Asian countries between 1989 and 2010. In comparison with quinine, parenteral artesunate: - reduced mortality from severe malaria by about 40% in adults (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.50–0.75, five trials, 1664 participants, high-quality evidence); - reduced mortality from severe malaria by about 25% in children (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65–0.90, four trials, 5765 participants, high-quality evidence); and - was associated with a small increase in neurological sequelae in children at the time of hospital discharge (RR, 1.36; 215 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 95% CI, 1.01–1.83, three trials, 5163 participants, moderate-quality evidence), most of which, however, slowly resolved, with little or no difference between artesunate and quinine 28 days later (moderate-quality evidence).

Other considerations The guideline development group considered that the small increase in neurological sequelae at discharge after treatment with artesunate was due to the delayed recovery of the severely ill patients, who would have died had they received quinine. This should not be interpreted as a sign of neurotoxicity. Although the safety of artesunate given in the first trimester of pregnancy has not been firmly established, the guideline development group considered that the proven benefits to the mother outweigh any potential harm to the developing fetus. Remarks Parenteral artesunate is recommended as first-line treatment for adults, children, infants and pregnant women in all trimesters of pregnancy. Rationale for the recommendation The Guideline Development Group considered the small increase in neurological sequelae at discharge associated with artesunate to be due to prolonged recovery of severely ill patients who would have died if they had received quinine. This should not be interpreted as a sign of neurotoxicity. Although the safety of artesunate in the first trimester of pregnancy has not been firmly established, the group considered that the proven benefits to the mother outweigh the potential harms to the developing fetus. Strong recommendation for Treating severe malaria in children (2015) Children weighing < 20 kg should receive a higher dose of artesunate (3 mg/kg bw per dose) than larger children and adults (2.4 mg/kg bw per dose) to ensure equivalent exposure to the drug. *Not evaluated using the GRADE framework; recommendation based on pharmacokinetic modelling Practical info Artesunate is dispensed as a powder of artesunic acid, which is dissolved in sodium bicarbonate (5%) to form sodium artesunate. The solution is then diluted in approximately 5 mL of 5% dextrose and given by intravenous injection or by intramuscular injection into the anterior thigh. The solution should be prepared freshly for each administration and should not be stored. Artesunate is rapidly hydrolysed in- vivo to dihydroartemisinin, which provides the main antimalarial effect. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of parenteral artesunate in children with severe malaria suggest that they have less exposure than older children and adults to both artesunate and the biologically active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. Body weight has been identified as a significant covariate in studies of the pharmacokinetics of orally and rectally administered artesunate, which suggests that young children have a larger apparent volume of distribution for both compounds and should therefore receive a slightly higher dose of parenteral artesunate to achieve exposure comparable to that of older children and adults.

Thus, post-treatment haemolysis is a predictable event related to the life-saving effect of artesunate. Hyperparasitaemic patients must be followed up carefully to identify late-onset anaemia. Justification The dosing subgroup reviewed all available pharmacokinetic data on artesunate and the main biologically active metabolite dihydroartemisinin following administration of artesunate in severe malaria (published pharmacokinetic studies from 71 adults 216 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) and 265 children)[262][263]. Simulations of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin exposures were conducted for each age group. These showed underexposure in younger children. The revised parenteral dose regimens are predicted to provide equivalent artesunate and dihydroartemisinin exposures across all age groups. Other considerations Individual parenteral artesunate doses between 1.75 and 4 mg/kg have been studied and no toxicity has been observed. The GRC concluded that the predicted benefits of improved antimalarial exposure in children are not at the expense of increased risk. 5.2.2.2 Parenteral alternatives when artesunate is not available Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Parental alternatives when artesunate is not available (2015) If artesunate is not available, artemether should be used in preference to quinine for treating children and adults with severe malaria. Practical info Artemether Artemether is two to three times less active than its main metabolite dihydroartemisinin. Artemether can be given as an oil- based intramuscular injection or orally. In severe falciparum malaria, the concentration of the parent compound predominates after intramuscular injection, whereas parenteral artesunate is hydrolysed rapidly and almost completely to dihydroartemisinin. Given intramuscularly, artemether may be absorbed more slowly and more erratically than water-soluble artesunate, which is absorbed rapidly and reliably after intramuscular injection. These pharmacological advantages may explain the clinical superiority of parenteral artesunate over artemether in severe malaria. Artemether is dispensed dissolved in oil (groundnut, sesame seed) and given by intramuscular injection into the anterior thigh. Therapeutic dose:The initial dose of artemether is 3.2 mg/kg bw intramuscularly (to the anterior thigh). The maintenance dose is 1.6 mg/kg bw intramuscularly daily.

Therapeutic dose:The initial dose of artemether is 3.2 mg/kg bw intramuscularly (to the anterior thigh). The maintenance dose is 1.6 mg/kg bw intramuscularly daily. Quinine Quinine treatment for severe malaria was established before the methods for modern clinical trials were developed. Several salts of quinine have been formulated for parenteral use, but the dihydrochloride is the most widely used. The peak concentrations after intramuscular quinine in severe malaria are similar to those after intravenous infusion. Studies of pharmacokinetics show that a loading dose of quinine (20 mg salt/kg bw, twice the maintenance dose) provides therapeutic plasma concentrations within 4 h. The maintenance dose of quinine (10 mg salt/ kg bw) is administered at 8-h intervals, starting 8 h after the first dose. If there is no improvement in the patient’s condition within 48 h, the dose should be reduced by one third, i.e. to 10 mg salt/kg bw every 12 h. Rapid intravenous administration of quinine is dangerous. Each dose of parenteral quinine must be administered as a slow, rate-controlled infusion (usually diluted in 5% dextrose and infused over 4 h). The infusion rate should not exceed 5 mg salt/kg bw per h. Whereas many antimalarial drugs are prescribed in terms of base, for historical reasons quinine doses are usually recommended in terms of salt (usually sulphate for oral use and dihydrochloride for parenteral use). Recommendations for the doses of this and other antimalarial agents should state clearly whether the salt or the base is being referred to; doses with different salts must have the same base equivalents. Quinine must never be given by intravenous bolus injection, as lethal hypotension may result. Quinine dihydrochloride should be given by rate-controlled infusion in saline or dextrose solution. If this is not possible, it should be given by intramuscular injection to the anterior thigh; quinine should not be injected into the buttock in order to avoid sciatic nerve injury. The first dose should be split, with 10 mg/kg bw into each thigh. Undiluted quinine dihydrochloride at a concentration of 300 mg/ mL is acidic (pH 2) and painful when given by intramuscular injection, so it is best to administer it 217 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) either in a buffered formulation or diluted to a concentration of 60–100 mg/mL for intramuscular injection. Gluconate salts are less acidic and better tolerated than the dihydrochloride salt when given by the intramuscular and rectal routes.

The dangers of insufficient treatment (i.e. death from malaria) exceed those of excessive initial treatment. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Is parenteral artesunate superior to parenteral quinine in preventing death from severe malaria? Desirable effects: - In children > 12 years and adults, parenteral artesunate probably prevents more deaths than intramuscular artemether (moderate-quality evidence). - No randomized controlled trials have been conducted in children aged ≤ 12 years. -- Is intramuscular artemether superior to parenteral quinine in preventing death from severe malaria? Desirable effects: - In children, artemether is probably equivalent to quinine in preventing death (moderate-quality evidence). - In children > 5 years and adults, artemether may be superior to quinine (moderate-quality evidence). - Artemether is easier to administer, requiring a smaller fluid volume for intramuscular injection.

Overall certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes: moderate. -- Is intramuscular artemether superior to parenteral quinine in preventing death from severe malaria? Overall certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes: moderate. Justification GRADE A systematic review of intramuscular artemether for severe malaria comprised two randomized controlled trials in Viet Nam in which artemether was compared with artesunate in 494 adults, and 16 trials in Africa and Asia in which artemether was compared with quinine in 716 adults and 1447 children[264]. The trials were conducted between 1991 and 2009. In comparison with artesunate, intramuscular artemether was not as effective at preventing deaths in adults in Asia (RR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.09–2.97; two trials, 494 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Artemether and artesunate have not been directly compared in randomized trials in African children. In comparison with quinine: - Intramuscular artemether prevented a similar number of deaths in children in Africa (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.76–1.20; 12 trials, 1447 participants, moderate-quality evidence). - Intramuscular artemether prevented more deaths in adults in Asia (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42–0.83; four trials, 716 participants, moderate-quality evidence). 218 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Other considerations Indirect comparisons of parenteral artesunate and quinine and of artemether and quinine were considered by the guideline development group with what is known about the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs.

Recommendation If parenteral artesunate is not available, use artemether in preference to quinine for treating children and adults with severe malaria. Strength of recommendation Conditional for. Rationale for the recommendation The Guideline Development Group considered the possible superiority, the ease of administration and the better adverse-event profile of artemether as sufficient to recommend artemether over quinine as a second-line treatment option for severe malaria. 5.2.2.3 Pre-referral treatment options The risk for death from severe malaria is greatest in the first 24 h, yet, in most malaria-endemic countries, the transit time between referral and arrival at a health facility where intravenous treatment can be administered is usually long, thus delaying the start of appropriate antimalarial treatment. During this time, the patient may deteriorate or die. It is therefore recommended that patients, particularly young children, be treated with a first dose of one of the recommended treatments before referral (unless the referral time is <6 h). The recommended pre-referral treatment options for children <6 years, in descending order of preference, are intramuscular artesunate; rectal artesunate; intramuscular artemether; and intramuscular quinine. For older children and adults, the recommended pre-referral treatment options, in descending order of preference, are intramuscular injections of artesunate; artemether; and quinine. Administration of an artemisinin derivative by the rectal route as pre-referral treatment is feasible and acceptable even at community level. The only trial of rectal artesunate as pre-referral treatment showed the expected reduction in mortality of young children but unexpectedly found increased mortality in older children and adults. As a consequence, rectal artesunate is recommended for use only in children aged <6 years and only when intramuscular artesunate is not available.

When rectal artesunate is used, patients should be transported immediately to a higher-level facility where intramuscular or intravenous treatment is available. If referral is impossible, rectal treatment could be continued until the patient can tolerate oral medication. At this point, a full course of the recommended ACT for uncomplicated malaria should be administered. 219 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) The single dose of 10 mg/kg bw of artesunate when given as a suppository should be administered rectally as soon as a presumptive diagnosis of severe malaria is made. If the suppository is expelled from the rectum within 30 min of insertion, a second suppository should be inserted and the buttocks held together for 10 min to ensure retention of the dose. Strong recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Pre-referral treatment options (2015) Where complete treatment of severe malaria is not possible, but injections are available, adults and children should be given a single intramuscular dose of artesunate, and referred to an appropriate facility for further care. Where intramuscular artesunate is not available, intramuscular artemether or, if that is not available, intramuscular quinine should be used. Where intramuscular injection of artesunate is not available, children < 6 years should be treated with a single rectal dose (10mg/kg bw) of artesunate, and referred immediately to an appropriate facility for further care. Rectal artesunate should not be used in older children and adults. Practical info Adjustment of parenteral dosing in renal failure of hepatic dysfunction The dosage of artemisinin derivatives does not have to be adjusted for patients with vital organ dysfunction. However, quinine accumulates in severe vital organ dysfunction. If a patient with severe malaria has persisting acute kidney injury or there is no clinical improvement by 48 h, the dose of quinine should be reduced by one third, to 10 mg salt/kg bw every 12 h. Dosage adjustments are not necessary if patients are receiving either haemodialysis or haemofiltration. Follow-on treatment The current recommendation of experts is to give parenteral antimalarial drugs for the treatment of severe malaria for a minimum of 24 h ounce started (irrespective of the patient’s ability to tolerate oral medication earlier) or until the patient can tolerate oral medication, before giving the oral follow-up treatment. After initial parenteral treatment, once the patient can tolerate oral therapy, it is essential to continue and complete treatment with an effective oral antimalarial drug by giving a full course of effective ACT (artesunate + amodiaquine, artemether+ lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine).

If the patient presented initially with impaired consciousness, ACTs containing mefloquine should be avoided because of an increased incidence of neuropsychiatric complications. When an ACT is not available, artesunate + clindamycin, artesunate + doxycycline, quinine + clindamycin or quinine + doxycycline can be used for follow-on treatment. Doxycycline is preferred to other tetracyclines because it can be given once daily and does not accumulate in cases of renal failure, but it should not be given to children < 8 years or pregnant women. As treatment with doxycycline is begun only when the patient has recovered sufficiently, the 7-day doxycycline course finishes after the artesunate, artemether or quinine course. When available, clindamycin may be substituted in children and pregnant women. Continuing supportive care Patients with severe malaria require intensive nursing care, preferably in an intensive care unit where possible. Clinical observations should be made as frequently as possible and should include monitoring of vital signs, coma score and urine output. Blood glucose should be monitored every 4 h, if possible, particularly in unconscious patients. Please refer toThe use of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severePlasmodium falciparummalaria, 2023 update[287]and thefield guide on the pre-referral treatment with rectal artesunate of children with suspected severe malaria[282]. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Desirable effects: - No studies of direct comparison of rectal artesunate with parenteral antimalarial drugs for pre- referral treatment. - In hospital care, parenteral artesunate reduces the number of deaths to a greater extent than parenteral quinine (high-quality evidence) and probably reduces the number of deaths from that with intramuscular artemether (moderate-quality evidence). 220 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Certainty of the Moderate evidence Overall certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes: moderate.

The displacement of large numbers of people with little or no immunity within malaria-endemic areas increases the risk for malaria epidemics among the displaced population, while displacement of people from an endemic area to an area where malaria has been eliminated can result in re- introduction of transmission and a risk for epidemics in the resident population. Climate change may also alter transmission patterns and the malaria burden globally by producing conditions that favour vector breeding and thereby increasing the risks for malaria transmission and epidemics. Parasitological diagnosis during epidemics In the acute phase of epidemics and complex emergency situations, facilities for laboratory diagnosis with good-quality equipment and reagents and skilled technicians are often not available or are overwhelmed. Attempts should be made to 221 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) improve diagnostic capacity rapidly, including provision of RDTs. If diagnostic testing is not feasible, the most practical approach is to treat all febrile patients as suspected malaria cases, with the inevitable consequences of over-treatment of malaria and potentially poor management of other febrile conditions. If this approach is used, it is imperative to monitor intermittently the prevalence of malaria as a true cause of fever and revise the policy", "page_start": 221, "page_end": 222, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

If diagnostic testing is not feasible, the most practical approach is to treat all febrile patients as suspected malaria cases, with the inevitable consequences of over-treatment of malaria and potentially poor management of other febrile conditions. If this approach is used, it is imperative to monitor intermittently the prevalence of malaria as a true cause of fever and revise the policy appropriately. This approach has sometimes been termed “mass fever treatment”. This is not the same as and should not be confused with “mass drug administration”, which is administration of a complete treatment course of antimalarial medicines to every individual in a geographically defined area without testing for infection and regardless of the presence of symptoms. Management of uncomplicated falciparum malaria during epidemics The principles of treatment of uncomplicated malaria are the same as those outlined in section 5.2. Active case detection should be undertaken to ensure that as many patients as possible receive adequate treatment, rather than relying on patients to come to a clinic. Epidemics of mixed falciparum and vivax or vivax malaria ACTs (except artesunate + SP) should be used to treat uncomplicated malaria in mixed-infection epidemics, as they are highly effective against all malaria species. In areas with pureP. vivaxepidemics, ACTs or chloroquine (if prevalent strains are sensitive) should be used. Anti-relapse therapy forP. vivaxmalaria Administration of 14-day primaquine anti-relapse therapy for vivax malaria may be impractical in epidemic situations because of the duration of treatment and the difficulty of ensuring adherence. If adequate records are kept, therapy can be given in the post-epidemic period to patients who have been treated with blood schizontocides. Malaria elimination settings Use of gametocytocidal drugs to reduce transmission ACT reducesP. falciparumgametocyte carriage and transmission markedly, but this effect is incomplete, and patients presenting with gametocytaemia may be infectious for days or occasionally weeks, despiteACT. Thestrategy ofusingasingle dose of primaquine to reduce infectivity and thusP. falciparumtransmission has been widely used in low transmission settings. Use of primaquine as aP. falciparumgametocytocide has a particular role in programmes to eliminateP. falciparummalaria. The population benefits of reducing malaria transmission by gametocytocidaldrugsrequirethatahighproportion of patients receivethesemedicines. WHO recommends the addition of a single doseofprimaquine (0.25 mg base/kg bw) to ACT for uncomplicated falciparum malaria as a gametocytocidal medicine, particularly as a component of elimination programmes. A recent review of the evidence on the safety and effectiveness of primaquine as a gametocytocide ofP. falciparumindicates that a single dose of 0.25 mg base/kg bw is effective in blocking infectivity to mosquitos and is unlikely to cause serious toxicity in people with any of the G6PD variants. Thus, the G6PD status of the patient does not have to be known before primaquine is used for this indication.

Thus, the G6PD status of the patient does not have to be known before primaquine is used for this indication. Artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria Artemisinin resistance inP. falciparumis now prevalent in parts of Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam. There is currently no evidence for artemisinin resistance outside these areas. The particular advantage of artemisinins over other antimalarial drugs is that they kill circulating ring-stage parasites and thus accelerate therapeutic responses. This is lost in resistance to artemisinin. As a consequence, parasite clearance is slowed, and ACT failure rates and gametocytaemia both increase. The reduced efficacy of artemisinin places greater selective pressure on the partner drugs, to which resistance is also increasing. This situation poses a grave threat. In the past chloroquine resistant parasites emerged near the Cambodia–Thailand border and then spread throughout Asia and Africa at a cost of millions of lives. In Cambodia, where artemisinin resistance is worst, none of the currently recommended treatment regimens provides acceptable cure rates (> 90%), and continued use of ineffective drug regimens fuels the spread of resistance. In Cambodia use of atovaquone–proguanil instead of ACT resulted in very rapid emergence of resistance to atovaquone. In this dangerous, rapidly changing situation, local treatment guidelines cannot be based on a solid evidence base; however, the risks associated with continued use of ineffective regimens are likely to exceed the risks of new, untried regimens with generally safe antimalarial drugs. At the current levels of resistance, the artemisinin derivatives still provide significant antimalarial activity; therefore, longer courses of treatment with existing or new augmented combinations or treatment with new partner medicines (e.g. artesunate + pyronaridine) may be effective. Studies to determine the best treatments for artemisinin- resistant malaria are needed urgently. It is strongly recommended that single-dose primaquine (as a gametocytocide) be added to all falciparum malaria treatment regimens as described in section 5.2.5. For the treatment of severe malaria in areas with established artemisinin resistance, it is recommended that parenteral artesunate and parenteral quinine be giventogetherin full doses, as described in section 5.5. 222 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 5.2.3.2 Quality of antimalarial drugs The two general classes of poor-quality medicines are those that arefalsified(counterfeit), in which there is criminal intent to deceive and the drug contains little or no active ingredient (and often other potentially harmful substances), and those that are substandard, in which a legitimate producer has included incorrect amounts of active drug and/or excipients in the medicine, or the medicine has been stored incorrectly or for too long and has degraded.

Falsified antimalarial tablets and ampoules containing little or no active pharmaceutical ingredients are a major problem in some areas. They may be impossible to distinguish at points of care from the genuine product and may lead to under-dosage and high levels of treatment failure, giving a mistaken impression of resistance, or encourage the development of resistance by providing sub-therapeutic blood levels. They may also contain toxic ingredients. Substandard drugs result from poor-quality manufacture and formulation, chemical instability or improper or prolonged storage. Artemisinin and its derivatives in particular have built-in chemical instability, which is necessary for their biological action but which causes pharmaceutical problems both in their manufacture and in their co-formulation with other compounds. The problems of instability are accelerated under tropical conditions. The requirement for stringent quality standards is particularly important for this class of compounds. Many antimalarial drugs are stored in conditions of high heat and humidity and sold beyond their expiry dates. In many malaria-endemic areas, a large proportion of the antimalarial drugs used are generic products purchased in the private sector. They may contain the correct amounts of antimalarial drug, but, because of their formulation, are inadequately absorbed. Antimalarial medicines must be manufactured according to good manufacturing practice, have the correct drug and excipient contents, be proved to have bioavailability that is similar to that of the reference product, have been stored under appropriate conditions and be dispensed before their expiry date. Tools to assess drug quality at points of sale are being developed, but the capacity of medicines regulatory agencies in most countries to monitor drug quality is still limited. Legal and regulatory frameworks must be strengthened, and there should be greater collaboration between law enforcement agencies, customs and excise authorities and medicines regulatory agencies to deal more effectively with falsified medicines. Private sector drug distribution outlets should have more information and active engagement with regulatory agencies. WHO, in collaboration with other United Nations agencies, has established an international mechanism to prequalify manufacturers of ACTs on the basis of their compliance with internationally recommended standards of manufacture and quality. Manufacturers of antimalarial medicines with prequalified status are listed on the prequalification web site[289]. Practice Statement Antimalarial drug quality (2015) National drug and regulatory authorities should ensure that the antimalarial medicines provided in both the public and the private sectors are of acceptable quality, through regulation, inspection and law enforcement. 5.2.3.3 Monitoring efficacy and safety of antimalarial drugs and resistance When adapting and implementing these guidelines, countries should also strengthen their systems for monitoring and evaluating their national programmes.

Routine surveillance WHO promotes universal coverage with diagnostic testing and antimalarial treatment and strengthened malaria surveillance systems. In the “test, track, treat” initiative, it is recommended that everysuspectedmalaria case is tested, that every confirmedcase is treated with a quality-assured antimalarial medicine and that the disease is tracked by timely, accurate surveillance systems. Surveillance and treatment based on confirmed malaria cases will lead to better understanding of the disease burden and enable national malaria control programmes to direct better their resources to where they are most needed. 223 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Therapeutic efficacy Monitoring of therapeutic efficacy in falciparum malaria involves assessing clinical and parasitological outcomes of treatment for at least 28 days after the start of adequate treatment and monitoring for the reappearance of parasites in blood. The exact duration of post-treatment follow-up is based on the elimination half- life of the partner drug in the ACT being evaluated. Tools for monitoring antimalaria drug efficacy can be found on theWHO website. PCR genotyping should be used in therapeutic monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy againstP. falciparumto distinguish between recrudescence (true treatment failure) and new infections. An antimalarial medicine that is recommended in the national malaria treatment policy should be changed if the total treatment failure proportion is ≥ 10%, as assessed in vivo by monitoring therapeutic efficacy. A significantly declining trend in treatment efficacy over time, even if failure rates have not yet fallen to the ≥ 10% cut-off, should alert programmes to undertake more frequent monitoring and to prepare for a potential policy change. The introduction of a new antimalarial medicine in the national treatment policy should be based on the treatment having an average cure rate of > 95% as assessed in clinical trials. Resistance Antimalarial drug resistance is the ability of a parasite strain to survive and/or multiply despite administration and absorption of an antimalarial drug given in doses equal to or higher than those usually recommended, provided that drug exposure is adequate. Resistance to antimalarial drugs arises because of selection of parasites with genetic changes (mutations or gene amplifications) that confer reduced susceptibility. Resistance has been documented to all classes of antimalarial medicines, including the artemisinin derivatives, and it is a major threat to malaria control.

Widespread inappropriate use of antimalarial drugs exerts a strong selective pressure on malaria parasites to develop high levels of resistance. Resistance can be prevented, or its onset slowed considerably by combining antimalarial drugs with different mechanisms of action and ensuring high cure rates through full adherence to correct dose regimens. If different drugs with different mechanisms of resistance are used together, the emergence and spread of resistance should be slowed. Clinical and parasitological assessment of therapeutic efficacy should include: - confirmation of the quality of the antimalarial medicines tested; - molecular genotyping to distinguish between re-infections and recrudescence and to identify genetic markers of drug resistance; - studies of parasite susceptibility to antimalarial drugs in culture; and - measurement of antimalarial drug levels to assess exposure in cases of slow therapeutic response or treatment failure Pharmacovigilance Governments should have effective pharmacovigilance systems (such as the WHO pregnancy registry) to monitor the safety of all drugs, including antimalarial medicines. The safety profiles of the currently recommended antimalarial drugs are reasonably well described and supported by an evidence base of several thousand participants (mainly from clinical trials); however, rare but serious adverse drug reactions will not be detected in clinical trials of this size, particularly if they occur primarily in young children, pregnant women or people with concurrent illness,who are usually under-represented in clinical trials. Rare but serious adverse drug reactions are therefore detected only in prospective phase IV post-marketing studies or population-based pharmacovigilance systems. In particular, more data are urgently needed on the safety of ACTs during the first trimester of pregnancy and on potential interactions between antimalarial and other commonly used medicines. Practice Statement Monitoring efficacy and safety of antimalarial drugs and resistance (2010) All malaria programmes should regularly monitor the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs using the standard WHO protocols. An antimalarial medicine that is recommended in the national malaria treatment policy should be changed if the total treatment failure proportion is ≥ 10%, as assessed in vivo by monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

National decision-making National decision-makers are encouraged to adopt inclusive, transparent, rigorous approaches. Broad, inclusive stakeholder engagement in the design and implementation of national malaria control programmes will help to ensure they are feasible, appropriate, equitable and acceptable. Transparency and freedom from financial conflicts of interest will reduce mistrust and conflict, while rigorous evidence-based processes will ensure that the best possible decisions are made for the population. Information required for national decision-making Selection of first- and second-line antimalarial medicines will require reliable national data on their efficacy and parasite resistance, which in turn require that appropriate surveillance and monitoring systems are in place (see Monitoring efficacy and safety of antimalaria drugs). In some countries, the group adapting the guidelines for national use might have to re-evaluate the global evidence base with respect to their own context. The GRADE tables may serve as a starting-point for this assessment. Decisions about coverage, feasibility, acceptability and cost may require input from various health professionals, community representatives, health economists, academics and health system managers. Opportunities and risks The recommendations made in these guidelines provide an opportunity to improve malaria case management further, to reduce unnecessary morbidity and mortality and to contribute to continued efforts towards elimination. Failure to implement the basic principles of combination therapy and rational use of antimalarial medicines will risk promoting the emergence and spread of drug resistance, which could undo all the recent gains in malaria control and elimination.

General guiding principles for choosing a case management strategy and tools Choosing a diagnostic strategy The two methods currently considered suitable for routine patient management are light microscopy and RDTs. Different strategies may be adopted in different health care settings. The choice between RDTs and microscopy depends on local circumstances, including the skills available, the patient case-load, the epidemiology of malaria and use of microscopy for the diagnosis of other diseases. When the case-load of patients with fever is high, the cost of each microscopy test is likely to be less than that of an RDT; however, high-throughput, high-quality microscopy may be less operationally feasible. Although several RDTs allow diagnosis of bothP. falciparumandP. vivaxinfections, microscopy has further advantages, including accurate parasite counting (and thus identification of high parasite density), prognostication in severe malaria, speciation of other malaria parasites and sequential assessment of the response to antimalarial treatment. Microscopy may help to identify other causes of fever. High-quality light microscopy requires well- trained, skilled staff, good staining reagents, clean slides and, often, electricity to power the microscope. It requires a quality assurance system, which is often not well implemented in malaria-endemic countries. In many areas, malaria patients are treated outside the formal health services, e.g. in the community, at home or by private providers. Microscopy is generally not feasible in the community, but RDTs might be available, allowing access to confirmatory diagnosis of malaria and the correct management of febrile illnesses. The average sensitivity of HRP2-detecting RDTs is generally greater than that of RDTs for detectingpLDH ofP. falciparum, but the latter are slightly more specific because the HRP2 antigen may persist in blood 225 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) for days or weeks after effective treatment. HRP2-detecting RDTs are not suitable for detecting treatment failure. RDTs are slightly less sensitive for detectingP. malariaeandP. ovale.The WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing programme provides comparative data on the performance of RDT products to guide procurement. Since 2008, 210 products have been evaluated in five rounds of product testing[207]. For the diagnosis of severe malaria, microscopy is preferred, as it provides a diagnosis of malaria and assessment of other important parameters of prognostic relevance in severely ill patients (such as parasite count and stage of parasite development and intra- leukocyte pigment). In severe malaria, an RDT can be used to confirm malaria rapidly so that parenteral antimalarial treatment can be started immediately. Where possible, however, blood smears should be examined by microscopy, with frequent monitoring of parasitaemia (e.g. every 12 h) during the first 2–3 days of treatment in order to monitor the response. Choosing ACT In the absence of resistance, all the recommended ACTs have been shown to result in parasitological cure rates of > 95%.

Although there are minor differences in the oral absorption, bioavailability and tolerability of the different artemisinin derivatives, there is no evidence that these differences are clinically significant in currently available formulations. It is the properties of the partner medicine and the level of resistance to it that determine the efficacy of a formulation. Policy-makers should also consider: - local data on the therapeutic efficacy of the ACT, - local data on drug resistance, - the adverse effect profiles of ACT partner drugs, - the availability of appropriate formulations to ensure adherence, - cost. In parts of South-East Asia, artemisinin resistance is compromising the efficacy of ACTs and placing greater selection pressure on resistance to the partner medicines. Elsewhere, there is no convincing evidence for reduced susceptibility to the artemisinins; therefore, the performance of the partner drugs is the determining factor in the choice of ACT, and the following principles apply: - Resistance to mefloquine has been found in parts of mainland South-East Asia where this drug has been used intensively. Nevertheless, the combination with artesunate is very effective, unless there is also resistance to artemisinin.Resistance to both components has compromised the efficacy of artesunate + mefloquine in western Cambodia, eastern Myanmar and eastern Thailand. - Lumefantrine shares some cross-resistance with mefloquine, but this has not compromised its efficacy in any of the areas in which artemether + lumefantrine has been used outside South-East Asia. - Until recently, there was no evidence of resistance to piperaquine anywhere, but there is now reduced susceptibility in western Cambodia. Elsewhere, the dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine combination is highly effective. - Resistance to SP limits its use in combination with artesunate to the few areas in which susceptibility is retained. - Amodiaquine remains effective in combination with artesunate in parts of Africa and the Americas, although elsewhere resistance to this drug was prevalent before its introduction in an ACT. Considerations in use of artemisinin-based combination therapy Oral artemisinin and its derivatives (e.g. artesunate, artemether, dihydroartemisinin) should not be used alone. In order to simplify use, improve adherence and minimize the availability of oral artemisinin monotherapy, fixed-dose combination ACTs are strongly preferred to co-blistered or co-dispensed loose tablets and should be used when they are readily available. Fixed-dose combinations of all recommended ACT are now available, except artesunate + SP. Fixed-dose artesunate + amodiaquine performs better than loose tablets, presumably by ensuring adequate dosing. Unfortunately, paediatric formulations are not yet available for all ACTs.

Although there are some minor differences in the oral absorption and bioavailability of different artemisinin derivatives, there is no evidence that such differences in currently available formulations are clinically significant. It is the pharmacokinetic properties of the partner medicine and the level of resistance to it that largely determine the efficacy and choice of combinations. Outside South-East Asia, there is no convincing evidence yet for reduced susceptibility to the artemisinins; therefore, the performance of the partner drug is the main determinant in the choice of ACT, according to the following principles: 226 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - Drugs used in IPTp, SMC or chemoprophylaxis should not be used as first-line treatment in the same country or region. - Resistance to SP limits use of artesunate + SP to areas in which susceptibility is retained.Thus, in the majority of malaria-endemic countries, first-line ACTs remain highly effective, although resistance patterns change over time and should be closely monitored. Choosing among formulations Use of fixed-dose combination formulations will ensure strict adherence to the central principle of combination therapy. Monotherapies should not be used, except as parenteral therapy for severe malaria or SP chemoprevention, and steps should be taken to reduce and remove their market availability. Fixed-dose combination formulations are now available for all recommended ACTs except artesunate + SP. Paediatric formulations should allow accurate dosing without having to break tablets and should promote adherence by their acceptability to children. Paediatric formulations are currently available for artemether + lumefantrine, dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine and artesunate + mefloquine. Other operational issues in managing effective treatment Individual patients derive the maximum benefit from an ACT if they can access it within 24–48 h of the onset of malaria symptoms. The impact in reducing transmission at a population level depends on high coverage rates and the transmission intensity. Thus, to optimize the benefits of deploying ACTs, they should be available in the public health delivery system, the private sector and the community, with no financial or physical barrier to access. A strategy for ensuring full access (including community management of malaria in the context of integrated case management) must be based on analyses of national and local health systems and may require legislative changes and regulatory approval, with additional local adjustment as indicated by programme monitoring and operational research.

To optimize the benefits of effective treatment, wide dissemination of national treatment guidelines, clear recommendations, appropriate information, education and communication materials, monitoring of the deployment process, access and coverage, and provision of adequately packaged antimalarial drugs are needed. Community case management of malaria Community case management is recommended by WHO to improve access to prompt, effective treatment of malaria episodes by trained community members living as close as possible to the patients. Use of ACTs in this context is feasible, acceptable and effective[293]. Pre-referral treatment for severe malaria with rectal artesunate and use of RDTs are also recommended in this context. Community case management should be integrated into community management of childhood illnesses, which ensures coverage of priority childhood illnesses outside of health facilities. Health education From the hospital to the community, education is vital to optimizing antimalarial treatment. Clear guidelines in the language understood by local users, posters, wall charts, educational videos and other teaching materials, public awareness campaigns, education and provision of information materials to shopkeepers and other dispensers can improve the understanding of malaria. They will increase the likelihood of better prescribing and adherence, appropriate referral and reduce unnecessary use of antimalarial medicines. Adherence to treatment Patient adherence is a major determinant of the response to antimalarial drugs, as most treatments are taken at home without medical supervision. Studies on adherence suggest that 3-day regimens of medicines such as ACTs are completed reasonably well, provided that patients or caregivers are given an adequate explanation at the time of prescribing or dispensing. Prescribers, shopkeepers and vendors should therefore give clear, comprehensible explanations of how to use the medicines. Co-formulation probably contributes importantly to adherence. User- friendly packaging (e.g. blister packs) also encourages completion of a treatment course and correct dosing. Practice Statement National adaptation and implementation (2010) The choice of ACTs in a country or region should be based on optimal efficacy, safety and adherence. An antimalarial medicine that is recommended in the national malaria treatment policy should be changed if the total treatment failure proportion is ≥ 10%, as assessed in vivo by monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

Interventions in the final phase of elimination and prevention of re-establishment TheGlobal technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030[4]urges all malaria-endemic countries to accelerate towards elimination and attainment of malaria-free status. WHO recommends that all countries ensure access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment as part of universal health coverage; recommendations related to these strategies can be found in sections 4 (Prevention) and 5 (Case Management) of these guidelines. Countries or areas that have attained very low to low levels of transmission require additional interventions in order to eliminate malaria. These interventions should: - accelerate the decline in malaria transmission to a level at which intensive surveillance, i.e. follow-up of every case, is feasible; - target specific groups at increased risk of infection that may not be reached adequately through routine prevention and treatment services; and - respond to individual cases and foci to interrupt transmission. Activities in settings approaching elimination will be most effective at reducing transmission if they are tailored to the distribution of the reservoir of malaria infection. Recommendations for the final phase of elimination are, therefore, divided into three categories of possible interventions: - ‘mass’ strategies applied to the entire population of a delimited geographical area, whether a hamlet, township or district; - ‘targeted’ strategies applied to people at increased risk of infection compared to the general population; and - ‘reactive’ strategies implemented in response to individual cases. At very low and low levels of transmission, malaria cases tend to cluster geographically and according to shared risk factors[295][296]. The premise behind targeted and reactive strategies is that interventions applied to a small subset of the population or a small area of the community believed to encompass the infectious reservoir of infection could reduce transmission overall. To capture the potential impact of the intervention on transmission, key outcomes are measured at the community level rather than only among those who actually receive or participate in the intervention. In post-elimination settings, malaria programmes must continue to actively intervene in order to prevent re-establishment of transmission.

Countries will need to ensure that diagnosis and treatment services are available everywhere as part of universal health coverage as 228 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) imported cases can be identified anywhere and at any time. However, the extent and intensity of additional activities during the post- elimination period will depend on the health system and the malariogenic potential of the area, that is, the degree of receptivity to transmission and the risk or rate of importation of malaria infections. Strategies targeted to specific higher-risk areas or groups, or in response to the identification of an imported or introduced infection, are required in post-elimination settings working to prevent re- establishment of transmission[297]. 6.1 Interventions recommended for mass implementation in delimited geographical areas In areas approaching elimination where transmission is generalized across the population of a defined geographical area (i.e. a district, village or focus), strategies that cover the whole population may be needed to reduce transmission. These strategies could include mass drug administration (MDA), mass relapse prevention (MRP) or mass testing and treatment (MTaT). Recommendations on MDA and MRP to reduce transmission ofP. falciparumandP. vivaxare presented under section 4.2.4 (Mass drug administration) in the Chemoprevention chapter of the malaria guidelines. Mass strategies are generally not recommended for post-elimination settings unless there is a resumption of local transmission of malaria. 6.1.1 Mass testing and treatment (MTaT) Mass testing and treatment (MTaT) involves parasitological testing of the entire population of a delimited geographical area and treatment of all positive cases with an appropriate antimalarial medicine at approximately the same time. MTaT is an active case detection strategy that may improve the timeliness and coverage of treatment. MTaT extends malaria diagnosis and treatment to people who experience barriers to care or who do not feel ill. MTaT is generally conducted using point-of-contact malaria rapid diagnostic tests but has also been conducted using microscopy and nucleic acid-based tests. Only people found to be positive receive a full therapeutic course of an effective antimalarial medicine. As a result, the intervention does not provide a population- level prophylactic period as MDA does. However, providing antimalarial medicine only to those who are known to be infected may improve adherence to treatment, population acceptance of the intervention and equity while decreasing the risk of unintended consequences.

The GDG noted that there may be exceptional circumstances under which MTaT might be appropriate, such as a transmission focus in a very low transmission or post-elimination setting where MDA is not an acceptable or feasible strategy. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms Seven studies of MTaT were included in the systematic review: four cRCTs, conducted in Kenya, Indonesia, Zambia and Burkina Faso; and three NRSs in Senegal, Ghana and India (Bhamaniet al unpublished evidence). Beneficial outcomes - MTaT does not reduce the prevalence of malaria two months after the last round (RD: -26 per 1000 population; 95% CI [CI] -68 to 15 per 100 persons; one cRCT; high-certainty evidence). - MTaT does not reduce the incidence of malaria 0–12 months after the start of the intervention (RD: -117 per 1000 p-y (p-y); 95% CI: -303 to 93 per 1000 p-y; one cRCT; high-certainty evidence). - MTaT probably results in little to no difference in the incidence of malaria (measured only in children) 6–12 months after the start of the intervention (RD: 4 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -2 to 8 per 1000 p-y; two cRCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). - MTaT reduces the incidence of clinical malaria 0–12 months after the start of the intervention (RD: -44 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -70 to -12 per 1000 p-y; two cRCTs; high-certainty evidence). 229 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Adverse events - Among people treated as part of MTaT, the most common adverse events were fever (0.023/person- day), headache (0.008/person-day, vomiting (0.006/person-day), cough (0.004/person-day), shivering (0.003/person-day) and nasal congestion (0.002/person-day) (one cRCT, not GRADEd because no information was available from the comparator arm). Judgement of the panel The GDG judged that the beneficial impact of MTaT on malaria incidence and prevalence at the community level was trivial, as were the potential adverse events. Certainty of the Moderate evidence The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be moderate. Values and No studies were identified regarding preferences and values. preferences The GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies.

Personnel and vehicles were the largest cost drivers, followed by trainings and rapid diagnostic tests. The estimated cost per DALYs averted was US$ 804, which in the context of Zambia was considered a highly cost-effective health intervention. The GDG judged the resources required to implement MTaT to be large. Although one study found MTaT to be a cost-effective intervention in the context of southern Zambia, the GDG judged the impact of the intervention in general to be likely trivial. Therefore, with high costs, the cost-effectiveness would probably favour not conducting MTaT. Equity No studies were identified that addressed the issue of whether MTaT increased or decreased health equity. The GDG felt that MTaT may favour disadvantaged segments of the population who otherwise might have limited or no access to the health system for diagnostic testing and treatment for malaria. Therefore, the GDG judged that MTaT would probably increase health equity. Acceptability The acceptability of MTaT was reported in three qualitative studies identified by the systematic review (Bhamaniet alunpublished evidence). One study in western Kenya found that the community engaged in an MTaT intervention reported concerns over testing in the absence of symptoms. These concerns were mostly related to the fear of covert HIV testing and some lack of understanding of the possibility of asymptomatic malaria. Other issues related to acceptability were failure to adhere to the full treatment course, treatment effectiveness and the need for intense sensitization activities. In the post- implementation round, although many participants appreciated the intervention and expressed an overall positive experience, some concerns remained, including fear of covert HIV testing and failure to adhere to treatment. One study in Zambia aimed to understand perceptions of community health workers and community members on MTaT. In general, MTaT was perceived very positively by most community health workers and community members. However, some barriers identified by community health workers 230 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) included difficult transportation to hard-to-reach areas; difficulty charging personal digital assistants for data collection due to unavailability of charging sources; and commodity shortages. Among community participants, most barriers were related to the perceived fears around covert HIV testing and use of blood samples for “Satanism”. Lack of community health worker skills and training to conduct testing and treatment was also a perceived barrier among some community members.

Lastly, this study also identified the perceived feeling of wellness once symptoms subsided as a barrier to adherence to treatment. One study in Ghana assessed the perception of health workers and community members on MTaT. Overall, the health workers and community participants perceived MTaT as a feasible intervention with many benefits, including reducing incidence in children, increasing sensitization of the community on malaria, reducing hospital admissions, increasing work productivity, reducing expenditure for treatment, providing timely access to treatment at home, and reducing travel to health facilities. However, health care workers were concerned about revenue lost from internally-generated funds at the health facility. Some of the challenges experienced during MTaT were misconceptions and rumours (e.g. fear of being infected with epilepsy by health workers), concerns over the safety of drugs, and a lack of trust in health workers’ skills and knowledge. The GDG judged that MTaT was probably acceptable to key stakeholders. Feasibility The systematic review identified two studies reporting on the feasibility of MTaT campaigns in Kenya and Ghana (Bhamaniet alunpublished evidence). However, one MTaT campaign was implemented within a well developed and well maintained health and demographic surveillance system in Kenya. The other study from Ghana reported on the perception of MTaT as feasible by health workers and community members. The GDG noted that the type of parasitological test used (rapid diagnostic test, microscopy or nucleic acid based test) would affect the feasibility of implementing the strategy as tests that are not conducted at the point-of-contact would be more difficult to implement, require more staff with more technical training and likely delay identification and treatment of positive cases. The feasibility of implementing MTaT would also depend on whether radical cure ofP. vivaxusing an 8-aminoquinoline medicine was part of the MTaT strategy, which would necessitate testing for G6PD deficiency, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. The GDG judged that MTaT was probably a feasible intervention to implement. Justification The GDG judged that there was moderate certainty evidence that MTaT had a trivial impact on malaria prevalence and incidence. Although there may be some benefit to health equity by reaching people who may otherwise have difficulty accessing malaria diagnostic and testing services, and the intervention was found to be acceptable to stakeholders and feasible to implement, the resources required to implement MTaT were considered to be large. The GDG felt that there may be transmission foci in very low transmission settings where an MTaT intervention could be beneficial but decided to provide a conditional recommendation against implementing MTaT to reduce the transmission of malaria.

This research should include evaluation of the feasibility of implementation and acceptability of the strategy to health care workers and community members. Data on the cost of the strategy and the cost-effectiveness compared to passive surveillance are needed. 6.2 Interventions targeting infections in people at higher-risk At any level of malaria transmission, there may be situations that put some individuals at greater risk of infection than the general population. When transmission declines to low or very low levels, malaria infections may be more frequent among people who work or enjoy their leisure where they are more exposed to malaria vectors. Higher-risk situations are often associated with outdoor or night- time activities and include mining, guarding, rubber tapping, forest activities, cattle herding, military and police exercises, night-time sports, socializing outdoors and sleeping outside. 231 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) If there are defined situations that that lead to a large proportion of the infections in an area, it may be equally effective but more equitable, acceptable and cost-effective to target interventions to people exposed to these situations rather than to the entire population. While it is clear that those who receive the intervention will benefit from treatment of any extant infections they may have as well as prevention of infection during the prophylactic period, the impact of targeted strategies on community-level transmission of malaria will depend on the extent to which malaria is transmitted in other settings. The term ‘targeted’ is used here to differentiate strategies based on defined higher-risk settings from ‘mass’ strategies that are based on a defined geographical area. Targeted strategies could involve chemoprevention (i.e. targeted drug administration [TDA]) or testing and treatment of confirmed positives (i.e. targeted testing and treatment [TTaT]). There are parallels between different ‘targeted’ and ‘mass’ strategies related to the type of intervention and the population included (Table 1).

Border screening is a testing and treatment strategy used to detect infections among people crossing by land, sea or air into an area that is post-elimination or with very low to low levels of transmission. Testing may be implemented as routine screening of all consenting individuals passing through a border crossing. Alternatively, organized or identifiable groups may be tested and treated through various approaches in the days immediately following arrival or return. In post-elimination settings, preventing infections in nonimmune residents travelling to malaria-endemic areas through chemoprophylaxis would likely be a more effective approach than treating them upon return. Chemoprophylaxis is used to reduce infections, severe illness and death in non-immune people who travel to malaria-endemic areas. People living in areas approaching elimination or post-elimination will lose their immunity to malaria over time. Therefore, recommendations related to chemoprophylaxis for travel of nonimmune individuals to malaria-endemic areas are applicable in these settings. Guidance on malaria chemoprophylaxis for travellers can be found in the WHOInternational travel and health guidance[2]. 6.2.1 Targeted drug administration (TDA) Targeted drug administration (TDA) is a form of chemoprevention involving the provision of a full therapeutic course of an antimalarial medicine to individuals at increased risk of malaria infection compared to the general population. Depending on the frequency and duration of exposure, TDA could be provided before, during or after potential exposure to malaria transmission. The antimalarial medicines given during TDA treat all existing infections and prevent new infections over the duration of the drug’s post-treatment prophylaxis period. At minimum, a TDA strategy deploys an antimalarial medicine that targets the asexual, blood- stage malaria parasites (e.g. ACTs or chloroquine). TDA interventions may include additional medicines that target hypnozoites in the liver (e.g. primaquine for radical cure ofP. vivax) or gametocytes in the blood (e.g. single, low-dose primaquine forP. falciparum). TDA, as opposed to MDA, is provided to specific individuals or a subset of the population rather than to everyone present within a delimited geographical area. The premise of the strategy is that providing chemoprevention to individuals whose occupations or behaviours put them at increased risk of malaria infection may reduce transmission in the community if their infections constitute a large proportion of the infectious reservoir. If found to be effective, a targeted strategy is likely to be more resource-efficient, acceptable, feasible and equitable than a mass strategy. 232 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation for , Very low certainty evidence Targeted drug administration to reduce transmission of malaria (2022) In areas with very low to low transmission or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention to people with increased risk of infection relative to the general population to reduce transmission. - Persons", "page_start": 232, "page_end": 233, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Practical info TDA depends on detailed, recent knowledge of the epidemiology and ecology of malaria in an area. This knowledge is generally based on a strong passive surveillance system that can detect all suspected cases, diagnose infections, collect and analyse case- based data and characterize cases according to potential risk factors. (The ability to conduct case investigations at the home of the person diagnosed with malaria is not a requirement for a TDA programme but could potentially improve the quality of the data collected.) The persons given antimalarials in a TDA programme should be those with an increased risk of infection compared to the general population. This could include individuals in key demographic groups or with certain occupations or behaviours that are known to be associated with increased infection rates. Additionally, data from the surveillance system should demonstrate that infections in these individuals are likely to comprise a large proportion of the infectious reservoir in the area. Finally, the characteristics or risk factors that define the group at increased risk of infection should be easily recognizable or identifiable; if not, the TDA programme will be more challenging to implement and possibly less acceptable to stakeholders. Malaria elimination programmes implementing TDA should recognize that, as areas approach elimination, malaria infections become more concentrated in certain geographies and populations that may already be socially disadvantaged. This includes migrants, displaced persons, ethnic minorities and poor rural communities. A TDA programme should actively seek to prevent further adverse social impact on these groups. Language choices can frame the way that groups are perceived, and TDA programmes should avoid labelling groups of people as “reservoirs\" of infection or “hot” populations.

Referring to chemoprevention for malaria in higher-risk “situations” rather than higher-risk “groups” can shift the focus away from scapegoating certain populations. By engaging communities affected by malaria in elimination settings, including those that may be socially marginalized, malaria elimination programmes can improve their understanding of local social dynamics and identify strategies to provide better services to people at risk of malaria infection. TDA programmes should monitor the social impact of their interventions to determine if stigma is occurring to any malaria-affected populations and to determine whether their efforts to avoid stigma are working. Achieving high coverage of the affected population and good adherence to the antimalarial medicine are critical aspects of TDA programmes. TDA programmes ask many asymptomatic, healthy people to take a medicine when they do not feel ill, with the potential for adverse reactions to occur. Improving coverage and adherence requires development of understanding and trust in the institutions implementing the programme. Community engagement is thus a key factor in determining the success of TDA, to improve participation rates and adherence to the full treatment course of the medicine. A complete therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine, at doses recommended by the manufacturer, should be given to all eligible adults and children. Drug dosage should be determined by weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the person’s weight is unknown. The antimalarial medicines chosen for use in TDA should: a) be WHO recommended and prequalified; b) be efficacious against local parasites; c) be different from the medicine used as first-line treatment, where possible c) have a superior safety and tolerability profile; d) provide a longer duration of post-treatment prophylaxis with component medicines that have closely matched pharmacology to reduce the risk of new infections encountering only a single drug; e) have a positive public reputation and acceptability and f) be available and low-cost. Programmes in areas withP. falciparummay consider including a single, low-dose of primaquine in TDA programmes in order to increase the 233 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) gametocytocidal effect, although no evidence of an additional benefit from provision of single low-dose primaquine in a TDA programme was reviewed. A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly-observed single dose is preferred to multi-day regimens. Depending on the medicine chosen, certain population groups may need to be excluded from TDA, such as: pregnant women in their first trimester; infants < 6 months of age or weighing <5kgs; people recently treated with the same medicine; people with a known allergy to the medicine; anyone with severe acute illness or unable to take oral medication; people taking medication known to interact with the medicine used for TDA; and people with specific contraindications", "page_start": 233, "page_end": 234, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Although rarely implemented in the same area, TDA should not be given to individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. seasonal malaria chemoprevention, perennial malaria chemoprevention, or intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy)[161]. Programmes contemplating providing medicine for radical cure ofP. vivaxhypnozoites as part of TDA programme should carefully consider whether it is feasible to administer this treatment regimen safely, i.e. with testing for G6PD deficiency prior to treatment, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. Programmes should consider whether sufficient coverage and adherence to the full course of radical cure can be achieved. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review identified two cRCTs in Kenya and Uganda and three NRSs conducted in Ghana, Greece and Sri Lanka assessing the impact of TDA on malaria transmission compared to no TDA (Tusell et alunpublished evidence). Only one study reported measures of malaria transmission at the community level, while the other studies reported on outcomes only among the individuals targeted by the intervention. Three studies (two cRCTs and one NRS) were conducted in areas of moderate to high transmission and two NRSs were conducted in areas preventing re-establishment of transmission. The GDG determined that TDA would be most appropriate in very low to low transmission or post- elimination settings. The GDG decided that the PICO question should be modified accordingly (i.e. limited to such settings) and that only the two NRSs conducted in post-elimination settings should be considered as direct evidence of the impact of TDA. Beneficial outcomes - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TDA on the prevalence of malaria. (Both NRSs found no malaria cases in either the targeted group or the community after use of TDA in migrant workers among whom malaria had been detected prior to the intervention; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events - One NRS monitored adverse events 1–5 months post-intervention and no serious adverse events were reported during or after the treatment. - One NRS recorded adverse events in 397 out of the 1094 treated individuals; the majority were classified as minor: predominantly dizziness and headache for chloroquine and abdominal pain for primaquine. A single case of primaquine-induced haemolysis was recorded in a person with an incorrect G6PD test result.

The GDG judged the potential benefits of the TDA strategy in some settings to be large, particularly if TDA contributes to the prevention of re-establishment of transmission. The potential undesirable effects of TDA were judged to be small. The GDG determined that the balance of effects probably favoured TDA in settings of very low to low transmission or post-elimination of malaria. Certainty of the Very low evidence 234 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low. Values and No studies were identified regarding preferences and values. preferences The GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies. Resources No studies on the cost or cost-effectiveness of TDA in areas of very low to low transmission or post- elimination settings were found. The GDG judged that the costs required to implement TDA were moderate, and that cost-effectiveness probably favoured implementation of TDA. Equity No studies were identified addressing the issue of whether TDA increased or decreased health equity. However, one article was identified that discussed the potential for strategies such as TDA to lead to social stigmatization if care was not taken to choose terms and descriptions carefully and focus on higher risk situations rather than specific groups[276]. The GDG judged that a targeted strategy that intervenes in a small group of people more affected by malaria than the population surrounding them would likely improve health equity. However, the GDG recognized that, although malaria is not itself a stigmatizing disease, targeting specific groups might raise fears that they were sources of contagion and could lead to social isolation and stigmatization. Acceptability No studies were identified addressing the issue of acceptability of TDA in areas of very low to low transmission or post-elimination of malaria.

Justification Although the quality of evidence was very low, the GDG concluded that the balance of effects probably favoured implementing TDA, particularly in post-elimination settings to prevent re-establishment of transmission. As long as it is relatively simple to identify individuals or groups at increased risk of infection, and care is taken to avoid stigmatizing these groups, TDA is likely to be more equitable, acceptable and feasible than mass strategies involving the entire population of an area. Research needs - Further evidence is needed on the impact (prevalence and incidence of malaria infection at the community level ) and potential harms/unintended consequences of TDA for malaria in very low to low transmission or post-elimination settings. - Evidence is needed on the acceptability, feasibility, impact (prevalence and incidence of malaria infection at the community level) and potential harms/unintended consequences (death, hospital admission, severe anaemia or any severe adverse events) of safe provision (including testing for G6PD deficiency and, additionally, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services) of an 8-aminoquinoline as part of TDA for radical cure ofP. vivaxinfections. - Investigate approaches to characterizing higher-risk situations with respect to their contribution to the overall human infectious reservoir. 235 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) - Evidence is needed to optimize the delivery of TDA with respect to the synchronicity of treatments, time intervals between rounds of treatment, number of rounds needed per year and number of years needed to sustainably reduce malaria transmission. - Evidence is needed on whether TDA stigmatizes groups that might already be socially isolated, such as migrants or refugee populations. 6.2.2 Targeted testing and treatment (TTaT) Targeted testing and treatment (TTaT) is the parasitological testing of individuals at increased risk of malaria infection and treatment of all positive cases with an appropriate antimalarial medicine.

As with TDA, the premise of the TTaT strategy is that diagnosing and treating infections in individuals whose occupations or behaviours put them at increased risk of malaria infection may reduce transmission in the community if their infections constitute a large proportion of the infectious reservoir. Unlike TDA, however, medicine is only provided to the positive cases in TTaT, reducing the number of people who benefit from protection during the drug’s prophylactic period. However, providing antimalarial medicine only to those who have confirmed infections may improve adherence to treatment, population acceptance of the intervention and equity while decreasing the risk of unintended consequences. Conditional recommendation against , Very low certainty evidence Targeted testing and treatment to reduce transmission of malaria (2022) Testing and treatment of people with an increased risk of infection relative to the general population to reduce the transmission of malaria is not recommended. The GDG noted that there may be limited circumstances under which targeted testing and treatment (TTaT) could be beneficial. For example, TTaT could be used when people at a higher risk of infection can be easily identified and chemoprevention is not acceptable to the population. Additionally, TTaT could be used if safe and effective implementation of radical cure to preventP. vivaxrelapses is only feasible for those with confirmed infections. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review identified three studies for inclusion: two cRCTs in Ghana and Kenya and one NRS in Malawi (Allenet alunpublished evidence). Only one study reported measures of malaria transmission outcomes at the community level. No studies were conducted in very low to low transmission or post-elimination settings. The GDG determined that the TTaT strategy would be most relevant in very low to low transmission or post-elimination settings and, therefore, decided that the PICO question should be modified accordingly (i.e. limited to such settings). As a result, the GDG did not consider evidence on benefits from the studies included in the review. The potential harms (i.e. adverse events) from the intervention were considered likely to be trivial, as people who received treatment would be infected with malaria and, therefore, would receive treatment according to national guidelines. The judgements of the GDG related to the balance of effects was based on its expert opinions and indirect information from related interventions, such as MTaT and TDA. The GDG judged that the balance of effects probably favoured not implementing TTaT. 236 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Certainty", "page_start": 236, "page_end": 237, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

Resources No studies on the cost or cost-effectiveness of TTaT in very low to low transmission or post-elimination settings were found. The GDG judged that the costs required to implement TTaT were moderate, and that the cost- effectiveness probably favoured not implementing TTaT. Equity No studies were identified that addressed the issue of whether TTaT increased or decreased health equity. The GDG judged that a targeted strategy that intervenes in a small group of people more affected by malaria than the population surrounding them would improve health equity. Acceptability No studies were identified that addressed the issue of acceptability of TTaT in areas of very low to low transmission or post-elimination of malaria. The GDG judged that TTaT was probably acceptable to stakeholders, as it is a type of active case detection. Feasibility No studies were identified that addressed the issue of feasibility of TTaT in areas of very low to low transmission or post-elimination of malaria. The GDG noted that the type of parasitological test used (rapid diagnostic test, microscopy or nucleic acid-based test) would affect the feasibility of implementing the strategy as tests that are not point-of- contact would be more difficult to implement, require more technical staff and delay identification and treatment of positive cases. The feasibility of implementing TTaT would also depend on whether radical cure ofP. vivaxusing an 8-aminoquinoline medicine was part of the TTaT strategy, which would necessitate testing for G6PD deficiency, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. The GDG judged that implementation of TTaT was probably feasible. Justification The GDG judged that the likely impact of TTaT on malaria transmission in very low to low or post-elimination settings would be trivial, based on experiences with MTaT, challenges with detecting very low parasite densities and a lack of diagnostics for hypnozoites. The GDG felt that there may be specific situations where TTaT could be beneficial, for example, when the parasite reservoir is very clearly limited to a small group of people and infections are detectable.

Research needs While further evidence of the impact (prevalence and incidence of malaria infection at the community level) of TTaT could change the direction or strength of the recommendation given the lack of published studies on the impact of TTaT, the GDG did not judge that this research gap was a priority. 237 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 6.2.3 Testing and treatment at points of entry to reduce importation of malaria Testing and treatment at points of entry (i.e. border screening) is the parasitological testing of individuals crossing a border whether by land, sea or air and treatment of all positive cases with an appropriate antimalarial medicine. Border screening has been used to try to reduce the number of imported cases of malaria into an area in order to eliminate or prevent re-establishment of malaria transmission. Border screening has generally been applied more often at land crossings than air or seaports. Routine malaria testing and treatment at land crossings is often implemented at the borders between countries approaching elimination and their neighbours with higher levels of malaria transmission. However, many borders are highly porous with uncounted unofficial crossing points, making it difficult to achieve a high coverage of testing and treatment. Rather than attempting to test and treat individuals at a land crossing, several malaria elimination programmes target organized groups, such as the military or pilgrims, or set up testing and treatment at the points where migrant workers will be employed, such as plantations. This latter approach may improve the acceptability and feasibility of the strategy but depends on good multisectoral collaboration and knowledge of travel patterns. Under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and for public health purposes, national authorities in the country of arrival may require travellers to undertake a non-invasive medical examination that would achieve the public health objective of preventing the international spread of disease, while respecting travellers’ dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms[299]. The IHR recommend that countries that share a land border consider entering into agreements concerning the prevention or control of international transmission of disease at ground crossings; public health measures to prevent international transmission of malaria may apply.

No studies of the impact of testing and treatment at points of entry on the rate of malaria importation were found by the systematic review. Routine testing and treatment for malaria at points of entry is unlikely to be acceptable or feasible to implement. Evidence to decision Certainty of the Very low evidence Conditional recommendation for , Very low certainty evidence Malaria testing and treatment of organized or identifiable groups arriving or returning from malaria-endemic areas (2022) In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, organized or identifiable groups arriving or returning from malaria-endemic areas can be tested and treated soon after entry to reduce importation of malaria. Relatively easy access to these groups within a short time after entry is required for this strategy to be feasible and acceptable. This strategy may be particularly critical to areas in post-elimination that are working to prevent re-establishment of transmission. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review identified seven NRSs in six countries (Cambodia, China, Equatorial Guinea, Greece, Myanmar and the United Arab Emirates that reported on testing and treatment at points of entry (Coma-Croset alunpublished evidence). None of the studies provided information on the outcome 238 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) considered critical by the GDG, i.e. the number of positive cases identified by the strategy as a proportion of all imported cases found in the country during the same period. The GDG noted that border screening may take two forms: the traditional approach of testing and treatment of individuals at the time of entry through land crossings, seaports or airports; and the testing and treatment of organized or identifiable groups (e.g. military, migrant workers or religious pilgrims) recently arriving or returning from malaria-endemic areas. Because there are clear differences in the feasibility and acceptability of these two approaches, the GDG developed two separate recommendations. The benefits of testing and treatment at points of entry could not be assessed as no studies reporting on critical outcomes were identified by the review. The potential harms (i.e. adverse events) from the intervention were considered likely to be trivial, as people who received treatment would be infected with malaria and, therefore, treated according to national guidelines.

Values and No studies were identified regarding preferences and values. preferences The GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies. Resources The systematic review identified one study with data on the cost of testing and treatment at points of entry (Coma-Croset alunpublished evidence). One NRS study of testing and treatment of recently arrived migrant workers estimated that the programme cost US$ 226 080 annually between 2013 and 2017. No studies of the cost-effectiveness of testing and treatment at points of entry were identified. The GDG judged the costs required to implement testing and treatment at points of entry to be moderate, and the cost-effectiveness probably varied depending on whether the intervention was applied to individuals at the point of entry or to organized or identifiable groups immediately after arrival. In the latter case, the GDG judged that the intervention was probably cost-effective compared to not testing and treating organized or identifiable groups. Equity No studies were identified that addressed the issue of whether testing and treatment at points of entry increased or decreased health equity. The GDG judged that the testing and treatment of organized or identifiable groups was likely to be more equitable than the routine testing and treatment of individuals at the point of entry. Acceptability The systematic review identified two studies of acceptability(Coma-Croset alunpublished evidence). One study assessed the number of refusals for testing at border crossing points between Cambodia and Thailand, Viet Nam and Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Out of 4110 people approached, 904 (22%) refused to be tested for malaria. The main reasons for refusal included: not having enough time (51.6%); not perceiving themselves to be at risk of malaria and thus not requiring testing (40.6%); being scared to give blood (34.2%); and having an apparent language or cultural barrier (23.9%) (multiple answers possible).

The GDG judged that acceptance of testing and treatment at points of entry was likely to vary by stakeholder (less acceptable to travellers at the time of entry but potentially more acceptable to organized groups immediately after entry). Among travellers, acceptability is likely to vary considerably depending on factors such as the location of the screening, the time required and the travellers’ level of concern regarding possible malaria infection. Feasibility No studies on the feasibility of implementing testing and treatment at points of entry were identified. The GDG noted that the type of parasitological test used (rapid diagnostic test, microscopy or nucleic acid-based test) would affect the feasibility of implementing the strategy as tests that are not administered at point-of-contact would be more difficult to implement, require more technical staff and delay identification and treatment of positive cases. The GDG judged that the feasibility of implementing routine testing and treatment at points of entry would likely vary. Implementing such an intervention at airports or seaports was considered unlikely to be feasible due to the high volume of travellers and the time required to test and treat. The feasibility of implementing testing and treatment at land crossings was considered to be more feasible but would depend on the volume of travellers. Additionally, the feasibility of covering a high proportion of people crossing into the country through land crossings would depend on the strictness with which entry into the country was controlled and the porosity of the border. In most areas with porous borders, the GDG judged that the feasibility of implementing a testing and treatment with sufficient coverage at land crossings would be low. However, the feasibility of implementing testing and treatment among organized or identifiable groups arriving or recently returned from malaria-endemic areas was considered to be high. The GDG knew of many reports of military groups, labour migrants and religious groups in countries eliminating malaria or preventing re-establishment who were tested and treated for malaria after returning from periods in malaria-endemic areas. Justification With respect to routine testing and treatment at points of entry (land, sea or air), the GDG, in the absence of direct evidence, judged that the impact on importation of malaria was likely to be small except in areas nearing elimination or post-elimination. The GDG felt that the acceptability and feasibility of testing and treating for malaria at points of entry would be low given the likely disruption to travel. When considering organized or identifiable groups of people (e.g. military, migrant laborers or religious pilgrims) arriving or returning from malaria -endemic areas, the GDG judged that testing these groups for malaria and treating those who are positive could help countries nearing elimination or preventing re-establishment by reducing importation.

The acceptability and feasibility of this strategy was considered higher than routine testing and treatment at points of entry but would depend upon the local circumstances. Research needs - Evidence is needed on the efficiency (number of imported cases identified as a proportion of all imported cases identified during the same period) of testing and treating organized or identifiable groups of people arriving or returning from malaria- endemic areas in terms of the importation of malaria. - Investigate novel approaches to improving the efficiency of identifying and implementing testing and treatment among organized or identifiable groups, such as the plantation ambassador programme in Malaysia. 6.3 Interventions in response to detection of confirmed malaria cases As transmission declines and approaches zero, there is evidence that malaria cases tend to cluster more than at higher levels of transmission[295]. This clustering could occur geographically, in small areas such as households and neighbourhoods, or socially, among people exposed at the same time and place, such as through a common occupation or shared travel to endemic areas[296]. If clusters can be identified and targeted with effective interventions, malaria transmission at the community level may be reduced. 240 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Follow-up of confirmed cases of malaria at very low levels of transmission is one approach to identifying and targeting potential clusters of cases. A confirmed case of malaria, usually identified through passive case detection, is investigated to determine the likely location of infection. Interventions are subsequently implemented in and around the likely location of infection as well as among any people co-exposed with the index case. These strategies are called ‘reactive’ interventions because they are triggered ‘in reaction’ to the identification of a confirmed case of malaria. The radius of implementation of interventions around the index case will need to be determined according to the strategy implemented, the likelihood that malaria cases could be afebrile and the degree of clustering of cases. For reactive drug administration (RDA) and reactive case detection and treatment (RACDT), programmes could begin with a larger radius of implementation and then evaluate their data to determine whether scaling back the size of the area or limiting activity to just the household of the index case is likely to be the most efficient. For reactive IRS, information on the behaviors and likely flight range of local vector mosquitoes will be needed to determine a reasonable radius of implementation.

For reactive IRS, information on the behaviors and likely flight range of local vector mosquitoes will be needed to determine a reasonable radius of implementation. Because cases of malaria, whether imported or local, may be identified in post-elimination settings, reactive strategies are also relevant to areas working to prevent re-establishment of malaria. Although data on the effectiveness of strategies in these settings will be extremely rare, evidence from areas with ongoing transmission can serve as indirect evidence for the likely impact in post- elimination settings. Recommendations related to three reactive strategies, i.e. RDA, RACDT and reactive IRS, are reported below. 6.3.1 Reactive drug administration (RDA) RDA is the provision of antimalarial medicine as chemoprevention to every person living with or near a person with a confirmed malaria infection, or to every person who was likely exposed to infection at the same time and place as the index case. The antimalarial medicines given during RDA aim to treat all existing infections and prevent new infections over the duration of the drug’s post-treatment prophylaxis period. At minimum, an RDA strategy deploys an antimalarial medicine that targets the asexual, blood-stage malaria parasites (e.g. ACTs or chloroquine). RDA interventions may include additional medicines that target hypnozoites in the liver (e.g. primaquine for radical cure ofP. vivax) or gametocytes in the blood (e.g. single, low-dose primaquine forP. falciparum). Reactive interventions should target the likely location of infection of the index case. The likely location of infection is determined through a case investigation, using the date of symptom onset and knowledge of the incubation period of the specific parasite species to determine the location of the person during the likely period of infection. If the likely location of infection is a residence, RDA can be administered to at least the household of the confirmed case, but could also be extended to neighbours. If the infection was imported from elsewhere, RDA can be administered to individuals who may have had the same exposure as the index case, such as co-travellers and co-workers. Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Reactive drug administration for reducing malaria transmission (2022) In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention to all people residing with or near a confirmed malaria case and all people who share the same risk of infection (e.g. co-travellers and co-workers) to prevent or reduce malaria transmission. - Programmes implementing reactive drug administration (RDA) should have the capacity to conduct case investigations at the residence to determine the likely location of infection and to identify those individuals co-exposed with the index case. - Programmes implementing RDA should have the capacity to enumerate and provide antimalarials to the people residing with or near a confirmed malaria case", "page_start": 241, "page_end": 241, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

This includes residents in the same household or neighborhood, co-travellers and co-workers. However, if the infection was imported and the residence is not located in a receptive area, there may be no benefit from RDA. - Programmes contemplating implementation of RDA forP. vivaxshould carefully consider how to safely and feasibly administer treatment to prevent relapses. 241 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Practical info When used, RDA should be one of several components of a programme to eliminate or prevent re-establishment of malaria, including intensive follow-up of every case as described in theFramework for malaria elimination[9]. RDA depends on a strong passive surveillance system that detects suspected cases, tests all suspected cases for malaria with a quality-assured parasitological test and investigates all cases at their residence. If these elements are not in place, it is unlikely that an RDA intervention will have any effect on transmission. It is essential to determine the likely location of infection through a case investigation that identifies the location of the person during the likely period of infection in order to understand where or in what group of people the RDA intervention should take place. RDA should be administered to other residents of the same house if the person is determined to have been infected locally. Programmes may consider extending the radius of RDA to neighbours depending on the local epidemiology and ecology of malaria. If the index infection is not likely to have been acquired at the residence, programmes should administer RDA to all people identified as having the same exposure to infection as the index case. People with the same risk of infection are likely to be those who travelled, worked or engaged in leisure activities with the index case. If the infection was classified as imported from elsewhere and the household is not located in a receptive area, there may be no benefit to RDA.

Countries that are at very low or low transmission but not yet close to achieving zero indigenous cases should prioritize implementation of RDA and reactive IRS over RACDT. However, RACDT should be added on top of RDA when countries are closer to elimination to strengthen the sensitivity of the surveillance system to monitor progress towards elimination and, post- elimination, to provide additional evidence of a malaria-free status. RDA should be implemented according to standardized operating procedures (SOPs). A household listing of all people residing within the limits of RDA as specified by the SOPs should be developed and verified, along with a list of all people who may have been co-exposed. The RDA programme should seek to provide antimalarial medicine to everyone listed, using different approaches as needed to reach everyone at risk. Achieving high coverage of the targeted population and good adherence to the antimalarial medicine are critical aspects of RDA programmes. RDA programmes ask many asymptomatic, healthy people to take a medicine when they do not feel ill, with the potential for adverse reactions to occur. Improving coverage and adherence requires development of understanding and trust in the institutions implementing the programme. Community engagement is thus a key factor in determining the success of RDA, to improve participation rates and adherence to the full treatment course of the medicine. A complete therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine, at doses recommended by the manufacturer, should be given to all eligible adults and children. Drug dosage should be determined by weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the person’s weight is unknown. The antimalarial medicines chosen for use in RDA should: a) be WHO recommended and prequalified; b) be efficacious against local parasites; c) be different from the medicine used as first-line treatment, where possible c) have a superior safety and tolerability profile; d) provide a longer duration of post-treatment prophylaxis with component medicines that have closely matched pharmacology to reduce the risk of new infections encountering only a single drug; e) have a positive public reputation and acceptability and f) be available and low-cost. Programmes in areas withP. falciparummay consider including a single, low-dose of primaquine in an RDA programmes in order to increase the gametocytocidal effect, although there is no evidence of additional benefit from provision of of single low-dose primaquine in an RDA programme. A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly-observed single dose is preferred to multi-day regimens.

Although rarely implemented in the same area, RDA should not be given to individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. seasonal malaria chemoprevention, perennial malaria chemoprevention, or intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy). Programmes contemplating providing medicine for radical cure ofP. vivaxhypnozoites as part of RDA should carefully consider whether it is feasible to administer this treatment regimen safely, i.e. with testing for G6PD deficiency prior to treatment, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. Programmes should consider whether sufficient coverage and adherence to the full course of radical cure can be achieved. 242 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review identified six cRCTs in four countries of sub-Saharan Africa (Eswatini, Gambia, Namibia and Zambia) and one NRS from Peru assessing the impact of RDA (Steinhardtet alunpublished evidence(c)). Almost all infections from the cRCTs in Africa were due toP. falciparumwhile the NRS in Peru included mainlyP. vivaxinfections. The NRS from Peru provided chloroquine plus seven days of primaquine at a dosage of 0.5mg/kg. All studies except for the study from Zambia were from low- transmission settings. The results below report the absolute effects (risk differences) of the intervention, as these were used by the GDG in its judgements; relative effect sizes are available in the Research evidence. Beneficial outcomes - RDA may reduce malaria prevalence (RD: -5 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -9 to 2 per 1000 persons; four cRCTs; low-certainty evidence). - RDA probably reduces the incidence of parasitaemia (RD: -7 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -17 to 13 per 1000 p-y; two cRCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). - RDA probably results in little to no difference in the incidence of clinical malaria (RD: -2 per 1000 p-y; -4 to 1 per 1000 p-y; six cRCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of RDA on the incidence of clinical malaria.

In RDA arms with DP: - 123 (6.9%) mild adverse events were reported from 1775 participants receiving DP; all were resolved. - 75 (7.6%) adverse events were reported from 979 participants receiving DP; 69 were rated as mild and six as moderate. - 68 (3.8%) adverse events reported from 1776 participants receiving DP; 54 were rated as mild and 14 as moderate. In RDA arms using AL: - 17 (0.4%) adverse events were reported from 4247 participants. The NRS in Peru that used chloroquine plus seven days of primaquine for radical cure ofP. vivax hypnozoites reported no adverse events but there was no active pharmacovigilance system. Judgement of the panel The GDG judged both the benefits and undesirable effects of RDA to be small and the overall certainty of evidence to be low. The GDG noted that the comparator in several studies was RACDT rather than no RDA. As a result, the GDG judged that the systematic review likely underestimated the impact of RDA. Overall, the balance of effects was determined to favour neither the intervention nor the comparison. Certainty of the Low evidence The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be low. Values and No studies were identified regarding preferences and values. preferences The GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies. 243 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Resources The systematic review identified one study from Zambia with data on the financial and economic costs of RDA (Steinhardtet alunpublished evidence(c)). The study identified index cases through active rather than passive surveillance. The total cost of two rounds of RDA (with DP) conducted between 2014 and 2015, covering a total population of 132 393 was US$ 912 767 (all figures in 2015 US$). The mean cost per person reached was US$ 85.69 (interquartile range [IQR] US$39.92). The overall incremental costs per infection and case averted (vs. standard of care) for RDA were US$ 810 and US$ 6 353, respectively. In high transmission settings, the incremental costs per infection and case averted were US$ 429 and US$ 5951, respectively; in low transmission settings, they were US$ 1119 and US$ 6755, respectively. Incremental cost per DALY averted for infections and cases were US$ 4889 and US$ 38 344, respectively. The GDG judged the resources required for RDA to be large but dependent on the number of index cases. Equity No studies were identified that addressed the issue of whether RDA increased or decreased health equity. The GDG was unable to determine a judgement on equity.

Acceptability The systematic review identified six studies in four countries (Eswatini, Gambia, Namibia and Zambia) with information on acceptability (Steinhardtet alunpublished evidence(c)). Community acceptance of RDA was high (refusal rate of 2% or lower) in Namibia and Zambia. However, in Eswatini, the overall refusal rate was about 4%, with refusal rates of 1.4% (11/776) and 5.3% (65/1232) in seasons 1 and 2, respectively. In Namibia, participants expressed concern over having “to take medicine without feeling sick”. Similarly, participants in Gambia “generally considered it unnecessary to take medicine without having any symptoms”. Continued community sensitization has been recommended to mitigate these stigmas. In the systematic review, no studies reporting on the acceptability of RDA to health care workers or policymakers were found. The GDG judged that RDA was probably acceptable to key stakeholders given the high rate of participation in RDA programmes. Feasibility Data on the feasibility of implementing RDA were summarized from five studies in four countries (Eswatini, Gambia, Namibia and Zambia) (Steinhardtet alunpublished evidence(c)). All countries used a three-day regimen of an ACT. RDA coverage, defined as the proportion of index cases followed up, varied between countries with a low of 62.4% in Eswatini to about 97% in Gambia. RDA adherence data were abstracted from three studies in three countries (Eswatini, Gambia and Zambia). Full adherence, defined as taking all three doses of an ACT and verifying that no tablets remained in the blister pack, was above 90% in all the countries. The feasibility of implementing RDA would also depend on whether radical cure ofP. vivaxusing an 8-aminoquinoline medicine was part of the RDA strategy, which would necessitate testing for G6PD deficiency, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. The GDG judged that RDA was likely feasible to implement. Justification While the GDG concluded that the balance of effects favoured neither RDA nor the comparison, the panel judged that the intervention would likely have been more effective if studies had compared RDA to no RDA rather than to RACDT. The GDG judged that RDA was probably an acceptable, feasible and potentially cost-effective strategy when numbers of cases are low enough to permit programmes to conduct case investigations, including in post-elimination settings working to prevent re- establishment of infection.

RACDT is an active case detection strategy that may improve the timeliness and coverage of treatment. RACDT is generally conducted using point-of-contact malaria rapid diagnostic tests but has also been conducted using microscopy and nucleic acid-based tests. Only people found to be positive receive a full therapeutic course of an effective antimalarial medicine. As a result, the intervention does not provide a population-level prophylactic period as RDA does. In an RACDT strategy, individuals are provided with antimalarials only if they are round to be infected. As a result, the proportion of the population that is protected from new infections over the duration of the post-treatment prophylaxis period is substantially lower than the population that would be protected in an RDA intervention. However, providing antimalarial medicine only to those who are known to be infected may improve adherence to treatment, population acceptance of the intervention and equity while decreasing the risk of unintended consequences and depleting stocks of medicines. Reactive interventions that are applied geographically should target the likely location of infection of the index case. The likely location of infection is determined through a case investigation, using the date of symptom onset and knowledge of the incubation period for the specific parasite species to determine the location of the person during the likely period of infection. If the likely location of infection is a residence, RACDT can be conducted at least in the household of the person with", "page_start": 245, "page_end": 245, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

If the likely location of infection is a residence, RACDT can be conducted at least in the household of the person with the confirmed case, but could also be extended to neighbours. The radius of the intervention should be determined based on an understanding of the epidemiology of malaria in the area. If the index infection was imported from elsewhere, RACDT should be conducted among individuals who may have the same exposure as the index case, such as co-travellers and co-workers. As an active case detection strategy, RACDT is an essential component of the final phase of elimination as it improves the sensitivity of the surveillance system while maintaining specificity; RACDT accomplishes this by increasing testing in areas more likely to experience transmission of malaria. RACDT provides important information to countries close to elimination by identifying any additional cases around the index case that could suggest gaps in the surveillance system. Once countries have reached zero indigenous cases, RACDT provides additional evidence to the Malaria Elimination Certification Panel that the country has interrupted indigenous transmission. Conditional recommendation for , Very low certainty evidence Reactive case detection and treatment to reduce transmission of malaria (2022) In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, all people residing with or near a confirmed malaria case and all people who share the same risk of infection (e.g. co-travellers and co-workers) can be tested for malaria and treated if positive. Until an area is nearing elimination or is post-elimination, it is unlikely that reactive case detection and treatment (RACDT) will have any effect on malaria transmission. However, RACDT becomes an essential component of surveillance when countries are nearing interruption of transmission to monitor progress towards elimination. When countries are post-elimination and working towards certification, RACDT can strengthen a country’s claim that it has reached and maintained zero indigenous cases. RACDT is an essential part of surveillance and response to prevent re-establishment of malaria. 245 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Practical info RACDT should be implemented when areas are nearing interruption of transmission and malaria cases are rare. When used, RACDT should be one of several components of a programme to eliminate or prevent re-establishment of malaria, including intensive surveillance as described in theFramework for malaria elimination[9]. RACDT depends on a strong passive surveillance system that detects suspected cases, tests all suspected cases for malaria with a parasitological test and investigates all cases at their place of residence.

RACDT depends on a strong passive surveillance system that detects suspected cases, tests all suspected cases for malaria with a parasitological test and investigates all cases at their place of residence. RACDT complements this surveillance system through active case finding around index cases. It is essential to determine the likely location of infection through a case investigation that identifies the location of the person during the likely period of infection in order to understand where or in what group of people an RACDT intervention should take place. RACDT should be administered to other residents of the same house if the person is determined to have been infected locally. Programmes may consider extending the radius of RACDT to neighbours depending on the local epidemiology and ecology of malaria. If a person was not likely to have been infected at the residence, programmes should administer RACDT to all people identified as having the same risk of acquiring infection as the index case. People with the same risk of infection are likely to be those who travelled, worked or engaged in leisure activities with the index case. Countries that are at very low or low transmission but not yet close to achieving zero indigenous cases should prioritize implementation of RDA and reactive IRS over RACDT. However, RACDT may be added on top of RDA when countries are closer to elimination to strengthen the sensitivity of the surveillance system to monitor progress towards elimination and, post-elimination, to provide additional evidence of a malaria-free status. When RACDT and RDA are jointly implemented, chemoprevention is provided to everyone, irrespective of the results of the parasitological test. However, testing results are used to monitor progress towards elimination or demonstrate that the country has reached zero indigenous cases. RACDT should be implemented according to SOPs. A household listing of all people residing within the limits of RDA as specified by the SOPs should be developed and verified, along with a list of all individuals who may have been co-exposed. The RACDT programme should seek to test everyone listed, using different approaches as needed to reach everyone at risk. Malaria cases detected during RACDT should be treated with antimalarial medicine according to the national treatment protocol if not already provided chemoprevention through RDA. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review identified three cRCTs in three countries of sub-Saharan Africa (Eswatini, Namibia and Zambia) (Steinhardtet alunpublished evidence(d)).

Beneficial outcomes - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of RACDT on the prevalence of malaria (RD: 25 per 1000 persons; 95% CI [95% CI] -1 to 72 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; very low-certainty evidence). - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of RACDT on the incidence of clinical malaria (RD: 3 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -1 to 7 per 1000 p-y; three cRCTs; very low-certainty evidence). - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of RACDT on parasite prevalence among people who participate in RACDT (two NRSs; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events Three cRCTs reported on adverse events.

However, the GDG was unable to judge the benefit of RACDT as the cRCTs compared results with RDA rather than no intervention. The NRS studies provided results only for those who received the intervention, and as a result, could not provide evidence for the impact of RACDT on transmission. As a result, the GDG concluded that they could not judge whether the balance of effects favoured RACDT or not.

Costing models developed based on the experience of implementing partners, operational documents and costing studies from Ethiopia, Senegal and Zambia found that the average annual financial cost per capita (total population of 360 000 based on one region, three districts, 20 health facility catchment areas [HFCAs] each, and 6000 population per HFCA) were US$ 1.07 for the first year of RACDT, and US$ 0.65 per year for the subsequent five years (2014 US$) and the per capita economic cost was US$ 1.27 in first year of RACDT, and US$ 0.75 per year for the subsequent five years (2014 US$). Total costs for RACDT varied between study areas ranging from US$ 3469 in Indonesia to US$ 10 486 in Thailand for total personnel and US$ 257 (Indonesia) to US$13 969 (Thailand) for commodities, services and other costs. The variations in personnel, commodity, service and other costs specific to case investigation and RACDT activities are likely due to differences in programme structure and the level of integration of malaria-related activities into the broader healthcare system. In Zambia, the mean annual cost of RACDT per HFCA was US$ 1177 (median = US$ 923, IQR US$ 651–1417). The variation in costs was driven by the number of community health workers and index cases detected. Costs related to community health workers and data review meetings accounted for the largest share of total costs. Rapid diagnostic tests and medicines accounted for less than 10% of total costs. Cost models based on studies from Ethiopia, Senegal, and Zambia showed that targeted search radius and per diems paid to community health workers dominated intervention parameters. In Indonesia, at 0.4% prevalence of infection, the cost per infection detected was US$ 7070, which declined to US$ 1767 when the prevalence was 1.6%. Cost declines began to plateau thereafter. The GDG judged the resources required for RACDT to be moderate, depending on the number of index cases.

Similarly, in Senegal, the high RACDT participation has been attributed to advanced cascade sensitization, making follow-up appointments to follow up absent members, and conducting return visits to the compound on the same or next day. Lack of community confidence in community health workers’ ability to address diseases other than malaria and community unwillingness to visit community health workers for malaria testing were reported in Zambia. There were no studies reporting data directly on health care workers’ acceptance of RACDT. Related information was abstracted from two studies. In Zambia, community health workers reported lack of motivation to conduct RACDT, which was in part linked to community health workers feeling their community service went unrecognized. The lack of stipend or financial support was the biggest problem noted by community health workers, who were volunteers. The GDG judged that RACDT was probably acceptable to key stakeholders. Feasibility The systematic review identified feasibility and health systems considerations data from 17 studies, of which seven were from sub-Saharan Africa and eight from the Asia-Pacific region (Steinhardtet al unpublished evidence(d)). The proportion of households reached by RACDT varied across different geographical locations – from 49% of index case households investigated in Zanzibar to 100% in Jiangsu, China. Similarly, the proportion of households reached in a timely manner also varied across different locations – from about 20% in Zanzibar to 100% in China. Barriers and challenges to RACDT implementation were identified along all three steps of RACDT. First, index case detection and notification from private health facilities was low and these cases were largely reported to be missed by RACDT in Cambodia and Zanzibar. Collaborating and engaging the private sector in malaria surveillance systems has been identified as critical, particularly in areas where many patients resort to private providers, facilities including drug shops, and pharmacies. Within the public health sector, delayed presentation of malaria patients to health facilities, poor preparation of village clinics to participate in surveillance programmes, and the lack of adequate human resources and malaria rapid diagnostic tests haves been reported as barriers and challenges to effective implementation of RACDT. Second, the complexity of case investigation procedures and lack of standard operating procedures have been identified as barriers to effective case investigation. Difficulty with case classification (imported vs. local) due to incomplete travel histories has also been reported. During peak malaria transmission seasons, the proportions of case investigations conducted were lower than in other times mainly because community health workers were overwhelmed by patient volumes and there were insufficient numbers of malaria rapid diagnostic tests.

To overcome these barriers, authors from a study in Zambia suggested that the programme would benefit from additional community health workers or the suspension of RACDT during the high-transmission season. Third, difficulty accessing mountainous terrains, flooded areas, and border areas with highly mobile populations were reported as barriers to timely follow up during the RACDT intervention. To overcome the barriers posed by flooding during the rainy season, study authors from Zambia recommended that community health workers, particularly those serving flood-prone areas, be provided with rain gear and access to boats. Another barrier to effective implementation of RACDT was identified as the large numbers of households to screen, particularly in high-density areas of the Asia-Pacific region. Incomplete case investigation forms also limited follow-up and the lack of household-level listings of all individuals in the RACDT area meant that those conducting RACDT did not always know which households to include in the RACDT. Imported cases posed a major challenge for RACDT interventions. District-level responses alone were unlikely to be effective in interrupting transmission when most malaria cases were imported from outside the district. Communication and surveillance linkages with other operational districts and their malaria response teams were considered necessary. In the case of Bhutan, RACDT buffer zones sometimes extended beyond international borders, limiting implementation of adequate RACDT activities. Strengthened cross-border collaborations are needed to ensure adequate coverage of households across borders, as well as migrant and mobile populations. Other barriers to conducting effective RACDT were stockouts of malaria rapid diagnostic tests, which prevented testing around index cases, the limit of 248 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) detection of most rapid diagnostic tests, and the inability ofP. falciparum-only rapid diagnostic tests to detect other species and low-density infections. In Botswana, malaria microscopy was used as the gold standard for malaria diagnosis, so all RDT-positive malaria cases were re-examined by microscopy; however, it was challenging to ensure a high quality of malaria microscopy slides prepared by health centre staff in these settings. A lack of health care workers to conduct malaria activities and lack of surveillance officers at the district level were reported to result in inadequate supervision, case investigation and follow-up. Lack of motivation among health care workers to pursue case investigation and contact testing, particularly on weekends and public holidays, was also reported.

The GDG judged that RACDT was likely feasible to implement. Justification Although the GDG was not presented with any relevant evidence for the benefit of RACDT in reducing transmission of malaria, RACDT is considered an essential surveillance strategy for countries nearing elimination in order to ensure that there are no cases remaining around or associated with a confirmed case. The GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation for RACDT as a component of the end-stage of an elimination programme should be issued. Research needs No research needs were identified by the GDG. 6.3.3 Reactive indoor residual spraying Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is the application of a residual insecticide to the interior surfaces of dwellings (i.e. walls, ceilings, windows and doors) to kill resting mosquitoes and reduce malaria transmission. IRS is generally conducted campaign-style across a large geographical area or a higher-risk area prior to the start of a malaria transmission season (i.e. proactive spraying). By contrast, reactive IRS is the use of IRS in the houses of a confirmed case and neighbours at approximately the same time. Reactive IRS should be implemented in the likely location of infection of the index case. The likely location of infection is determined through a case investigation by using the date of symptom onset and knowledge of the incubation period for the specific parasite species in order to determine the location of the person during the likely period of infection. If the likely location of infection was a residence, reactive IRS should be deployed to the dwelling of the confirmed case and extended to neighbouring houses. If the index infection was imported, reactive IRS at the residence of the index case may still have some effect on reducing onward transmission. The size of the radius of implementation of reactive IRS should be determined by the behaviours and likely flight range of local vector mosquitoes. 249 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Conditional recommendation for , Moderate certainty evidence Reactive indoor residual spraying (2022) In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, indoor residual spraying of insecticide can be conducted in in the houses of confirmed cases and neighbours to prevent or reduce transmission of malaria. - In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings where proactive indoor residual spraying (IRS) is occurring, programmes can consider switching to reactive IRS only, depending on the receptivity of the area. - Programmes considering adding reactive IRS on top of proactive IRS should balance", "page_start": 249, "page_end": 250, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

IRS is most effective where the vector population is susceptible to the insecticide(s) being applied, the majority of mosquitoes feed and rest indoors and where most structures are suitable for spraying. - If the index infection was imported and the residence is not located in a receptive area, there may be no benefit from reactive IRS. Practical info Please refer to the Practical Info section for IRS (4.1.1) for more information on operational issues related to IRS. When used, reactive IRS should be one among several components of a programme to eliminate or prevent re-establishment of malaria, including intensive surveillance as described in theFramework for malaria elimination[9]. Reactive IRS depends on a strong passive surveillance system that detects suspected cases, tests all suspected cases for malaria with a parasitological test and investigates all cases at their place of residence. If these elements are not in place, it is unlikely that an reactive IRS intervention can be effectively implemented. It is essential to determine the likely location of infection through a case investigation that identifies the location of the person during the likely period of infection in order to understand where the reactive IRS intervention should take place. Reactive IRS should be applied to the residence if the person is determined to have been infected locally. Programmes should extend RIRS to neighbours, with the radius of implementation depending on the local epidemiology and ecology of malaria. If the index infection is not likely to have been acquired at the residence, reactive IRS might still reduce the chances of onward transmission. However, if the infection was classified as imported and the household is not located in a receptive area, there may be no benefit to reactive IRS. In very low to low transmission settings where standard IRS is occurring (proactive spraying), there may be advantages to programmes from switching to reactive IRS. Decisions to switch from standard IRS to reactive IRS should be based on assessments that include: - the potential risk of increasing malaria transmission by scaling back proactive IRS; - the potential cost savings; - the potential for increased acceptance and equity; and - the potential for reducing insecticide resistance. In settings where no standard IRS is occurring, reactive IRS may be beneficial, depending on the factors listed", "page_start": 250, "page_end": 250, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

In settings where no standard IRS is occurring, reactive IRS may be beneficial, depending on the factors listed below. - The programme has the capacity to conduct case investigations at the residences of cases to determine whether the case is imported or local. - The capacity of the vector control programme to respond quickly to conduct reactive IRS after identification of a confirmed case. - The population living in the houses where RIRS is applied are at risk of infection. - The majority of the vector population feeds and rests indoors. - The vectors are susceptible to the insecticide that is being deployed. - People mainly sleep indoors at night. - The majority of structures are suitable for spraying. 250 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Programmes considering adding reactive IRS on top of proactive IRS should balance the potential added benefit with the risk of insecticide resistance and increased cost, and develop protocols that take into account the time since the dwelling was last sprayed. Reactive IRS depends upon a strong passive surveillance system that detects suspected cases, tests all suspected cases for malaria with a parasitological test and investigates all cases at the residence. If these elements are not in place, it is unlikely that an reactive IRS intervention will have an impact on malaria transmission. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review identified two cRCTs in Namibia and South Africa (Gimniget alunpublished evidence). The study from Namibia (superiority trial design) was conducted as a 2x2 factorial design with RACDT alone, RDA alone, RACDT plus reactive IRS, and RDA plus reactive IRS. The study from South Africa was designed as a non-inferiority trial comparing reactive IRS to proactive IRS (used in defined priority areas) that reached one third of houses. The results below report the absolute effects (risk differences) of the intervention, as these were used by the GDG in its judgements; relative effect sizes are available in the Research evidence. Beneficial outcomes - Reactive IRS reduces the prevalence of malaria (RD: -27 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -35 to -8 per 1000 persons; one cRCT [superiority design]; high-certainty evidence). - Reactive IRS may have little to no effect on the incidence of clinical malaria. (RD: -14 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -32 to 4 per 1000 p-y; one cRCT [superiority design]; moderate-certainty evidence). - Reactive IRS probably results in little to no difference in incidence of clinical malaria compared with proactive IRS (mean difference: 0.1 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -0.38 to 0.59 per 1000 p-y; one cRCT [non-inferiority design]; moderate-certainty evidence).

Judgement of the panel The GDG judged the benefits of reactive IRS to be moderate, undesirable effects to be trivial and the overall certainty of evidence to be moderate. The GDG noted that studies were only available from southern Africa. The variability of mosquito and human ecology may influence the effectiveness of the strategy where vectors differ from those in the trial areas. Additionally, the different designs (superiority vs. non-inferiority) and different comparators (no reactive IRS or proactive IRS) complicated the GDG’s judgement. However, the GDG judged that the balance of effects probably favoured reactive IRS. Certainty of the Moderate evidence The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be moderate. Values and No studies were identified regarding preferences and values. preferences The GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies. Resources The systematic review identified one study from South Africa with data on cost and cost-effectiveness of reactive IRS compared to proactive IRS (non-inferiority trial) (Gimniget alunpublished evidence). Over the two-year study, the average annual economic cost was US$ 184 319 per 100 000 population in the proactive IRS arm compared to US$ 88 258 per 100 000 population in the reactive IRS arm, a 52% cost savings. Using the cost per DALY, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated overall and 251 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) for each year of the study. It was estimated that per additional DALY averted, reactive IRS saved US$ 7845 (95% CI: US$ 2902–64 907) over proactive IRS. During year 1, when the incidence of malaria was low, the savings per additional DALY averted in the RIRS arm was estimated at US$ 35 149. The lower bound of the 95% CI was US$ 6481, while at the higher bound, RIRS was both less expensive and more effective. In year 2, when incidence was higher, the savings per additional DALY averted in the reactive IRS arm was US$ 3869 (95% CI: US$ 1371–50 689). The cost-effectiveness thresholds were set at US$ 2637 (43% of GDP per capita) and US$ 3557", "page_start": 251, "page_end": 252, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The cost-effectiveness thresholds were set at US$ 2637 (43% of GDP per capita) and US$ 3557 (58% of GDP per capita). At the incidence observed during the trial, reactive IRS would have a 94–98% probability of being the cost-effective choice at either threshold. It was estimated that reactive IRS would remain the preferred strategy up to an incidence of 2.0–2.7 cases per 1000 person-years using the higher and lower cost-effectiveness thresholds. The GDG judged that the resources required for reactive IRS are likely to vary depending on whether the programme is moving from proactive IRS to reactive IRS or starting an RIRS programme from scratch. The resource requirements are also likely to vary depending on the number of index cases. However, the GDG judged that cost-effectiveness probably favours reactive IRS. Equity No studies were identified that addressed the issue of whether reactive IRS increased or decreased health equity. Because reactive IRS focuses resources where they are needed, the GDG judged that reactive IRS probably increased health equity. Acceptability The systematic review identified one study from Namibia with information on the acceptability of reactive IRS (Gimniget alunpublished evidence). Refusals of households to participate in reactive IRS were due to lack of notification before arrival and reluctance to move furniture at short notice. In year two of the study, advance notification was provided to households and < 1% refused reactive IRS. Community participants generally considered reactive IRS to be a useful tool for malaria prevention, and participants in the study arms that did and did not receive reactive IRS indicated a desire to have their houses sprayed. Participants specifically referenced IRS’s effectiveness, noting reductions in both flies and mosquitoes. In the endline survey, 616 of 624 respondent (98.7%) from the reactive IRS arm indicated that they would participate in the same intervention again. The GDG noted that reactive IRS would likely be more accepted by households than proactive IRS because residents would know that a malaria case had been detected in or near their home. The GDG judged that reactive IRS was probably acceptable to key stakeholders. Feasibility The systematic review identified two case studies from China that reported on their implementation of reactive IRS (Gimniget alunpublished evidence). The GDG judged that reactive IRS was likely feasible to implement. Justification Proactive IRS applied campaign-style across a geographical area has long been a staple of malaria vector control and is currently recommended by WHO for large-scale deployment in areas of ongoing transmission.

The GDG judged that reactive IRS was likely feasible to implement. Justification Proactive IRS applied campaign-style across a geographical area has long been a staple of malaria vector control and is currently recommended by WHO for large-scale deployment in areas of ongoing transmission. Reactive IRS uses the same intervention (application of a residual insecticide to the interior surfaces of a dwelling) as does proactive IRS; however, reactive IRS is triggered by a single case of malaria and applied in a limited geographical area around the likely location of infection of the index case. When transmission is low and cases are clustered, the GDG noted that RIRS might be more cost-effective than proactive IRS as the area at risk of transmission is more limited. However, the benefits gained by introducing RIRS are likely to depend on whether the programme already has a proactive IRS programme or not; whether the programme intends to scale back proactive IRS to reactive IRS or add reactive IRS on top of proactive IRS; and the characteristics of the vector and human populations. As a result, the GDG provided a conditional recommendation for reactive IRS. Research needs - Further evidence is needed on the impact (prevalence and incidence of malaria infection at the community level) and potential harms/unintended consequences of reactive IRS. - Determine the impact (prevalence and incidence of malaria infection at the community level ) of reactive IRS in areas with 252 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) different mosquito behaviours. - Determine the impact (prevalence and incidence of malaria infection at the community level ) of reactive IRS in areas where P. vivaxis transmitted. - Investigate the optimal approach to delimiting the target area for implementation of reactive IRS around an index case. - Determine the optimal time interval between case detection and reactive IRS. - Determine whether additional rounds of reactive IRS should be repeated in the same households to prevent subsequent generations of transmission. - Determine the benefit and acceptability of switching from IRS to reactive IRS or adding reactive IRS on top of proactive IRS. 7. Surveillance Surveillance is “the continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of disease-specific data, and the use of that data in the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice”[300]. Pillar 3 of theGlobal technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030[4]is to transform malaria surveillance into a key intervention in all malaria- endemic countries and in those countries that have eliminated malaria but remain susceptible to re-establishment of transmission. Although surveillance guidance isnot evaluated using the GRADE framework, surveillance forms is the basis of operational activities in settings at any level of transmission and is therefore included in these Guidelines for reference. The objective of surveillance is to support reduction of the burden of malaria, eliminate the disease and prevent its re-establishment.

Although surveillance guidance isnot evaluated using the GRADE framework, surveillance forms is the basis of operational activities in settings at any level of transmission and is therefore included in these Guidelines for reference. The objective of surveillance is to support reduction of the burden of malaria, eliminate the disease and prevent its re-establishment. In settings where transmission remains relatively high and the aim of national programmes is to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality, malaria surveillance is often integrated into broader routine health information systems to provide data for overall analysis of trends, stratification and planning of resource allocation. In settings where malaria is being eliminated, the objectives of surveillance are to identify, investigate and eliminate foci of continuing transmission, prevent and cure infections, and confirm elimination. After elimination has been achieved, the role of surveillance becomes that of preventing re-establishment of malaria. A malaria surveillance system comprises the people, procedures, tools and structures necessary to generate information on malaria cases and deaths. The information is used for planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating malaria programmes. An effective malaria surveillance system enables programme managers to: - identify and target areas and population groups most severely affected by malaria, to deliver the necessary interventions effectively and to advocate for resources; - regularly assess the impact of intervention measures and progress in reducing the disease burden and help countries to decide whether adjustments or combinations of interventions are required to further reduce transmission; ◦ detect and respond to epidemics in a timely way; ◦ provide relevant information for certification of elimination; and ◦ monitor whether the re-establishment of transmission has occurred and, if so, guide the response. - Surveillance systems are increasingly supported by digital platforms, including DHIS2, georeferenced master facility lists, and data quality assessments that strengthen trust in data and decision-making. Integration across clinical, laboratory, entomological, and climate-related systems, enables programmes to design targeted responses, monitor drug and insecticide resistance, and anticipate risks such as urban transmission and climate-driven outbreaks. - With theMalaria Surveillance Assessment Toolkit ,WHO offers standardized tools to evaluate the performance of malaria surveillance systems, highlighting strengths and gaps while identifying areas for improvement to enhance data quality and use for informed decision-making. - WHO has published an online course,Malaria: Harnessing the power of routine health facility data, to strengthen the capacity of programmes in maintaining and using surveillance data at health facility focusing on the concept of disease surveillance, malaria surveillance processes, data quality, malaria data and interventions analysis, interpretation and use.

This guidance was developed in recognition of the increasing heterogeneity of malaria risk within countries as malaria control improves and the need to use problem-solving approaches to identify appropriate, context-specific packages of interventions to target different sub- populations. For example, case management should be accessible wherever there is a possibility of malaria cases seeking treatment. How case management is delivered will vary according to factors such as health-seeking behaviour, the accessibility and functioning of the public health infrastructure, availability of 253 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) the private retail sector and the potential for community services. Local data are essential to complete the malaria stratification and select the optimal mixes of interventions. The guidance explains how to undertake a comprehensive multi-indicator stratification process to define sub-national intervention mixes that are optimized to achieve strategic goals. As countries will rarely have all the resources they need to fully implement their ideal plan, a careful resource prioritization process is then required to maximize the impact of available resources. Prioritization should be based on the expected impact of interventions and consider value for money across the whole country, driven by local evidence. 8. Methods The consolidatedWHO Guidelines for malariawere prepared in accordance with WHO standards and methods for guideline development and originally published as theGuidelines for the treatment of malaria(3rdedition, 2015) and theGuidelines for malaria vector control(1st edition, 2019). Details of the approach can be found in the WHOHandbook for guideline development[1]. Here we provide an overview of the standards, methods, processes and platforms applied by the Global Malaria Programme across the topics covered in this guideline[122][302][303]and a description of the joint process (with WHO Immunization, Vaccination and Biologicals department) used to develop the malaria vaccine recommendation. Organization and process The WHO guideline development process involved planning; conducting a “scoping” and needs assessment; establishing an internal WHO Guidelines Steering Groups and external Guidelines Development Groups (GDGs); formulating clear questions using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format; commissioning evidence reviews or where a recent review was already available, commissioning an independent assessment of the review using the AMSTAR checklist[134]; applying GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology to assess the certainty of evidence; and using evidence-to- decision (EtD) frameworks to take the GRADE results and contextual factors into account in developing recommendations. This methodology ensuresthat the link between the evidence base and the recommendations istransparent.

Technical leads then obtaineddeclarations of interest from GDG members, assessed these and oversaw the management of any potential conflicts of interest, as well as the finalization and submission of a planning proposal to the Guidelines Review Committee (GRC) for review and approval. The GDGs -multistakeholder groups - were responsible for the development of the evidence-based recommendations contained in theGuidelines. As well as providing expert opinion, the specific tasks of the GDGs included: - providing inputs on the scope of theGuidelines; - building on the work of the Guidelines Steering Groups to finalize the key recommendation questions in PICO format; - choosing and ranking priority outcomes to guide the evidence reviews and focus the recommendations; - reviewing eligibility criteria for the inclusion of studies in the evidence reviews; - providing input on appropriate measures of outcomes of interest to be included in the evidence reviews; - validating the list of included and excluded studies; - reviewing the meta-analyses, GRADE evidence profiles or other assessments of the certainty of evidence used to inform the recommendations; - interpreting the evidence, considering different factors included in the EtD framework and judging how these factors may impact the direction and strength of a recommendation, particularly in terms of the overall balance of benefits and harms; - formulating recommendations, taking into account benefits, harms, values and preferences, feasibility, equity, acceptability, resource requirements, cost and cost-effectiveness and other factors, as appropriate; - identifying methodological shortcomings and evidence gaps in the available body of evidence, and providing guidance on how to address these as part of future research; - reviewing and approving the final recommendations prior to submission to the GRC; and - contributing to the dissemination of the final recommendations.

In selecting the chair of each GDG, each Steering Group ensured that the individual had content expertise, hadno conflicts of interest and wasable to approach the recommendations with an open mind, i.e. having no preconceptions about the final recommendations. Chairs of the GDGs and/or members were sensitized to ensure that equity, human rights, gender and social determinants were taken into consideration in efforts to improve public health outcomes. External Review Groups(ERGs) (see Section 10: Contributors and interests) were identified by the respective Steering Group for each technical area for malaria. Each ERG was composed of people interested in the subject of the Guidelines and included members of the Malaria Policy Advisory Group (MPAG; formerly the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee [MPAC]) and individuals affected by or interested in the recommendations, such as technical experts, end-users, programme managers, implementing partners, advocacy groups and funders.The ERGs reviewed the draft Guidelines prior to their submission to the GRC for approval. The role of each group was to identify any errors or missing evidence and to provide comment on clarity, context-specific issues, and implications for implementation. The groups were not expected to change the recommendations formulated by the GDGs. In cases where external reviewers raised major concerns related to the recommendations, these were taken back to the GDG for discussion. Comments from external reviewers were incorporated into the revised Guidelines as appropriate. The final drafts were circulated to the GDGs. Guideline methodologists Experts in guideline development processes complemented the technical expertise of the GDG members. Different methodologists supported the development of recommendations and guidance for each technical area.Methodologists were identified by the Steering Groups based on their experience, ensuring they had expertise in the prioritization of questions and outcomes, evidence synthesis, GRADEing of evidence, translation of evidence into recommendations, and guideline development processes. The methodologists supported the planning, scoping and development of key questions and assisted the GDG in formulating evidence-informed recommendations in a transparent and explicit manner. The methodologists served as the methodological co-chairs of some GDG meetings. Evidence synthesis methods Following the initial GDG meeting, existing systematic reviews already published were identified or new systematic reviews were commissioned to systematically assess the certainty of the evidence for each priority question across the guideline topics. Where there was an existing published review, the review was assessed independently using the AMSTAR-2 checklist[134].

Types of outcome measures for consideration in the evidence reviews included (but were not limited to): rate of all-cause child mortality; rate of severe malaria episodes; rate of clinical malaria; rate of uncomplicated episodes ofP. falciparumillness;parasite prevalence (also specificallyP. falciparumandP. vivaxprevalence); anaemia prevalence. In the case of vector control interventions, the reviews included both clinical outcomes and entomological outcomes, including but not limited to the inoculation rate (EIR); mosquito mortality and blood-feeding success; density of immature vector stages; and number of larval sites positive for immature vector stages. Harms and undesirableoutcomes such as adverse events, development of antimalarial drug resistance,reduced use of other malaria interventions or changes in mosquito behaviour were also assessed, where appropriate, to permit determination of the balance of benefits and harms.Epidemiological outcomes, namely, demonstration that an intervention has proven protective efficacy to reduce, prevent or eliminate infection and/or disease in humans, were prioritized over entomological outcomes, given that the correlation between the effect of interventions on entomological outcomes and the effect of interventions on public health outcomes has not been well established in all areas. Depending on the question posed, outcomes were measured at the individual and/or community level. The specific search methods, inclusion criteria, data collection and analysis plans for each evidence review were detailed in the published review protocols. Systematic review teams wereencouraged to publish their protocols in an online register of systematic reviews and to write their final reports using the 2020 PRISMA reporting guidelines. When limited evidence was available from randomized trials, somesystematic reviews included non-randomized studies such asquasi- experimental designs, including controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series (controlled and uncontrolled), and stepped wedge designs. As per WHO guidelines, the GDGs also considered systematically collected evidence on contextual factors (resources and costs, equity, acceptibility and feasibility) to develop the EtD frameworks. The GDGs used GRADEPro software and/or the MAGICapp platform, and the interactive EtD framework to assist in the process of evidence review and recommendation-setting. The EtD framework considered several criteria to arrive at a recommendation for or against an intervention; these were[122]: 255 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 1.

In some cases, the GDG opted to omit factors or add factors as deemed relevant. Values and preferences, acceptability, feasibilityandresourceneedsareimportantconsiderations.Given that these contextual factors are important in setting national policies and are broadly considered in the recommendation formulation process, efforts were made to collect information about these factors in preparation for the GDG meeting. This was achieved through systematic reviews of the literature, survey of stakeholders, or directly from the GDG. Expanded evidence-based recommendations on resource implications for malariainterventions, deployed alone or in combination, are a focus of ongoing work and guidance and will be developed where possible and incorporated into the Guidelines. Recommendations formulated before 2021 may not have included assessment of all factors. In MAGICapp, the EtD framework summaries for each of the recommendations contained in theWHO Guidelines for malariaare presented in a tab below the recommendation alongside the GRADE tables in the evidence profile tab. To streamline processes, from 2024 onward, second-in-class vector control interventions were assessed by the GDG to enable potential refinement existing recommendations. The GDG approached this by reviewing the available evidence on contextual factors (as outlined above) alongside any supporting information needed to inform their deliberations. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis Where the data was available, several potential effect modifiers were assessed through subgroup analyses. These included but were not limited to: - Insecticides used for both active ingredients and manufacturer - Malaria vector species - Setting (Urbanicity, classed as rural/urban/peri-urban) - Background interventions - Coverage of interventions Subgroups were assessed on their credibility of being a genuine effect modifier using the Instrument for assessing the Credibility of Effect Modification (ICEMAN)[304]. This is a tool that reviewers can use based on answering a series of questions that address specific criteria to evaluate whether an effect modification is likely. ICEMAN credibility assessment statements are expressed as very low (very likely no effect modification), low (likely no effect modification), moderate (likely effect modification), and high (very likely effect modification).

The certainty of evidence considered the study design, factors that would lead to rating down the certainty (the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision of the effect estimates, and publication bias) as well as factors that would lead to rating up the certainty (large effect size and dose-response effect). The terms used in the certainty assessments refer to the level of certainty in the estimate of effect relative to the recommendation question, and not necessarily to the scientific quality of the investigations reviewed. Informative statements of results for each outcome were aligned to the certainty of evidence based on standard GRADE methodology[305]. Table 1. The four categories of certainty of evidence used in GRADE Certainty of evidence Interpretation The Group is very confident in the estimate of effect and considers that further research is very unlikely to High change this confidence.

Very Low The Group is very uncertain about the estimate of effect. Formulation of recommendations The systematic reviews, GRADE tables and other relevant materials wereprovided to all members of the GDG prior to meeting to discuss particular key questions. Recommendations were formulated after considering the criteria included in the EtD framework listed above. After reviewing and judging the different criteria, the GDG discussed and reached a consensus on the final recommendation at in- personor online meetings,or through e-mail correspondence.Typically, the GDG was presented with a ‘neutral’ recommendation and decidedon its direction and strength. The guideline development process aimedto generate group consensus through open and transparent discussion. In most cases, anonymous voting was used to judge the different criteria and develop the final recommendation in order to reduce peer pressure. Voting was used as a starting point to build consensus or to reach a final decision when no consensuswas reached.For cases when voting is required, the threshold for a decision was agreed at the start of the GDG meeting. Types of guidance Two types of guidance are presented in theGuidelines:. - GRADEd recommendations: These recommendations were formulated by the GDG using the GRADE approach described above, supported by systematic reviews of the evidence, with formal assessment of the certainty of evidence.Recommendation are actionable statements to guide practice providing options for care. - Good practice statements: These statements reflect a consensus", "page_start": 256, "page_end": 257, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

These statements were not usually supported by a systematic review of evidence. In some cases, good practice statements were taken or adapted from existing recommendations or guidance initially developed through broad consultation, such as through the WHO Vector Control Technical Expert Group (VCTEG) or MPAG. These statements are made to reinforce the basic principles of good management practice and to support implementation. Strength of recommendations Each intervention recommendation was classified as strong or conditional, for or against an intervention, according to the GRADE system[303]. A strong recommendationis one for which the GDG was confident that the desirable effects of adhering to the recommendation outweighed the undesirable effects.A conditional recommendationis one for which the GDG concluded that the desirable effects of adhering to the recommendation probably outweighed the undesirable effects, but the GDG was not confident about these trade-offs. In addition to considering certainty of evidence regarding the benefits and harms and their relative effect, the strength of the recommendation was influenced by the contextual factors considered in the EtD framework. The reasons that favoured making a conditional recommendation includedlower certainty evidence; smaller effect sizes and/or a tight balance between benefits and harms; variability or uncertainty in the values and preferences of individuals regarding the outcomes of interventions; high costs; equity-related concerns; feasibility issues; and acceptability issues. The implications of strong and conditional recommendations for various groups are given inTable2. Table 2.

Management of conflicts of interest All members of the GDGs were requested to make declarations of interest, which were managed in accordance with WHO procedures and summarized at the beginning of each meeting to all participants. Where necessary, GDG members were excluded from the discussion and/or decision-making on topics for which they had declared interests that were considered conflicts. The members of the GDGs and a summary of their declarations of interest are listed in Section 10: Contributors and Interests. Link to WHO prequalification When a recommendation is linked to the introduction of a new tool or product, there is a parallel process managed by the WHO Prequalification Team to ensure that diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and vector control products meet global standards of quality, safety and efficacy, in order to optimize use of health resources and improve health outcomes. The prequalification process consists of a transparent, scientifically sound assessment that, includes dossier review, consistency testing or performance evaluation, and site visits to manufacturers. This information, in conjunction with other procurement criteria, is used by United Nations and other procurement agencies to make purchasing decisions regarding these health products. This parallel process aims to ensure that recommendations are linked to prequalified products and that prequalified products are linked to a recommendation for their use.

Joint process for developing the malaria vaccine recommendation In order to enable joint decision-making on a malaria vaccine, the different guideline development processes of the Global Malaria Programme and the WHO Department for Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals (IVB) were harmonized following discussion with the WHO Department of Quality, Norms and Standards. The standard process for the development of WHO vaccine recommendations was used as the basis for developing the malaria vaccine recommendation. The process employed by the Strategic Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, describedhere, complies with the principles and requirements of the standard GRC process which is described above and used for the development of theWHO Guidelines for malaria.MPAG members exceptionally participated in the guideline development process given their previous role in developing themalaria vaccine recommendation in 2015and because both advisory groups had been kept up to date with the progress of the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP). A SAGE/MPAG Working Group was established with Terms of Reference and an open call for members. The SAGE/MPAG Working Group members (biographies are publicly accessible on theWHO Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme website) were required to complete a Declaration of Interest (DOI) form prior to their appointment in advance of each meeting.Review of DOI forms revealed no relevant conflicts and all members participated in all discussions.Support for the closed sessions of the SAGE/MPAG Working Group’s full evidence review was provided by a restricted WHO Secretariat - known as the SAGE/MPAG Working Group Secretariat - composed of the IVB and GMP Directors, and other staff who were not involved in the generation or synthesis of evidence being reviewed by the MVIP Programme Advisory Group (see Section 10.2 Contributors – malaria vaccine). The SAGE/MPAGWorking Group performed the following functions: developed relevant and answerable question(s) in PICO format, reviewed and interpreted the evidence, with explicit consideration of the overall balance of benefits and harms; examined and provided input to the GRADE evidence profiles developed by the CochraneResponse; and formulated the proposed recommendations for SAGE/ MPAG in alignment with the 2019 RTS,S Framework for WHO recommendation(unpublished evidence), taking into accountbenefits, harms, values and preferences, feasibility, equity, acceptability, resource requirements and other factors, as appropriate. SAGE and MPAG were jointly convened on 6 October 2021 to review the work of the SAGE/MPAG Working Group,to consider themalaria vaccine evidence and to reach consensus ontheirvaccine recommendations to the Director-General of WHO[306][307]. Following the Director General's endorsement of the SAGE/MPAG recommendations, the evidence and deliberations that informed the WHO malaria vaccine position paper were put into the format required for the Weekly Epidemiological Record by the WHO Secretariat and reviewed by thea WHO Editorial Board as per thestandard SAGE process.

Contributors and interests The Guideline was consolidated for the first time in February 2021, building on previously published guidelines. The consolidation and coordination between the technical areas and GDGs was driven by Dr Pedro Alonso, former Director and Erin Shutes, former Programme Manager of the Global Malaria Programme to ensure consistency in approach and harmonization in the recommendations. The many contributors to the development of recommendations are acknowledged in the sub-sections below according to the evidence reviews of the intervention areas. Funding The consolidated WHO Guidelines for malaria, developed by the WHO Global Malaria Programme, were supported by multiple donors including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the United States Agency for International Development, and the Government of Spain. The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP), through which evidence was generated on the use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in routine immunization systems, was made possible through financial support received from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and Unitaid. Platform contribution WHO would like to acknowledge the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation for their support in the consolidation of the Guidelines on the MAGICapp platform. 10.1 Recommendations for vector control Members of the Guidelines Development Group (GDG) (2019) The WHO Technical Expert Group on Malaria Vector Control (VCTEG) served as the GDG and included: - Dr Constance Bart-Plange, Independent Malaria Consultant, Accra, Ghana - Professor Marc Coosemans, Department of Parasitology, Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium - Dr Camila Pinto Damasceno, FIOCRUZ Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro,Brazil - Dr Marcy Erskine, Senior Health Officer (Malaria), International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,", "page_start": 269, "page_end": 270, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

She is also the co-director of the BOVA network (Building Out Vector-Borne Diseases in Africa) from 2017 to date which is an interdisciplinary network focusing on preventing vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and zika disease through improving the built environment. From 2017-2020 she was co-chair of the RBM VCWG’s ‘Vector-Borne Diseases and the Built Environment Workstream’ (formerly ‘Housing and Malaria’). She has led key reviews on housing type or improvement and the impact on malaria. The first was a systematic review of housing improvements for malaria control, published in Malaria Journal 2015:Tusting, L.S., Ippolito, M.M., Willey, B.A.et al.The evidence for improving housing to reduce malaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Malar J14,209 (2015)https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-015-0724-1. The second and third were analyses of DHS data, studying the relationship between house type and malaria infection in children. Both were published in PLOS Med in 2017 and 2020:TustingLS, BottomleyC, GibsonH, KleinschmidtI, TatemAJ, et al.

PLOS Medicine 17(3): e1003055.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.100305.She was also a guest editor for a Malaria Journal thematic series on Housing and Malaria between 2015 and 2016. Dr Tusting also was involved in studies and reviews related to larval source management as a vector control tool but all these date to 2015 or earlier and she has not received any support towards work on this topic since and so it was concluded that this 274 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) did not constitute a conflict of interest. It was determined that Dr Tusting could participate in all parts of the meeting except for decision-making with respect to recommendations related to housing improvements. Five members of the External Review Group reported relevant interests; it was assessed that all members could fully participate as the remit of the Review Group was limited to identifying factual errors, providing clarity and commenting on implications for implementation not changing the recommendations formulated by the GDG. It was concluded that their expertise in some of these areas would be valuable, particularly on implementation considerations and factors to be considered associated with gender and social determinants, equity, and human rights. The relevant declared interests for theERG membersare summarized as follows: Umberto D’Alessandro reported receiving remuneration for the following activities which were topics of the meeting. He declared receiving research funding exceeding US$ 5000 in the last 4 years on three projects titled ‘Can improved housing provide additional protection against clinical malaria over current best practice?

Jennifer Armistead reported the following projects that she had been involved in in the past 4 years, where funding exceeded £5000 and which concerned topics for discussion during the meeting;Monitoring the deployment of PBO synergist ITNs in Ebonyi State, Nigeria, estimating coverage, and impact, funded by PMI; Impact of housing modifications combined with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) on malaria burden in Uganda, a collaboration between CDC, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK and Infectious Disease Research Collaboration, Kampala, Uganda; Determining the feasibility and effectiveness of larviciding, funded by PMI collaboration with PATH. Maureen Coetzee reported acting as supervisor for a PhD project to investigate whether integrated spatial information tools could enable targeted urban planning interventions to control malaria and lymphatic filariasis in Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania. This was a collaboration with Ifakara Health Institute, United Republic of Tanzania; Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute, Switzerland; Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK. This projectinvestigated housing characteristics that were associated with risk of mosquito biting but did not evaluate the impact of housing modifications on malaria Caroline Jones reported being a co-Investigator on a Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award: Improving the efficacy of malaria prevention in an insecticide resistant Africa whichaimed to investigate the factors limiting the efficacy of current tools to prevent malaria, largely insecticide-treated nets, and to identify the most cost effective, complementary interventions that would drive malaria transmission towards zero. Although this project could consider interventions under discussion by the ERG, it did not seek to systematically evaluate a particular tool.

The relevant declared interests for the GDG members are summarized as follows: Lucy Tusting declared receiving remuneration for consulting services exceeding US$ 5000 for WHO that ended in October 2022. This agreement was for providing support and input into the development of the WHO Urban Malaria Framework. She also received research funding exceeding US$ 5000 for a Medical Research Council (UK) fellowship that will continue until November 2023. The fellowship is on the role of improved housing on malaria. She has also received a grant from the NovoNordisk Foundation that involves risk mapping of malaria andAedes-borne diseases in Tanzania. The grant runs until 2026. 275 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Charles Wondji declared receiving research support, including grants, collaborations, sponsorships, and other funding from the Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC) exceeding US$ 5000. Ongoing studies aim to evaluate the entomological impact of more recently developed indoor residual spraying (IRS) products, dual active ingredient nets and pyrethroid-PBO nets against insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. Josh Yukich declared receiving salary support from his university through a project titled ‘New Nets’ to investigate the cost and cost effectiveness of dual active ingredient nets and pyrethroid- PBO nets. He also declared supervising students engaged in the analysis of the effectiveness of IRS and he has been engaged in similar analyses over the past several years whilst being employed by Tulane university. He is acting as a consultant for the University of California San Francisco to design and develop data collection tools for a cost effectiveness and willingness to pay study that involves topical repellents. In summary, three members of the GDG declared potential interests. Based on the detailed assessment of the information provided to WHO it was decided that Dr Lucy Tusting could participate in all sessions, while Dr Josh Yukich was to be recused from the decision- making processes where the impact of dual active ingredient nets and topical repellents against malaria were be determined and from the sessions where recommendations were formulated.

Thethird edition of theGuidelines for the treatment of malariawas prepared in accordance with the updated WHO standard methods for guideline development[1]. This involved planning, “scoping” and needs assessment, establishment of a GDG, formulation of key questions (PICO questions: population, participants or patients; intervention or indicator; comparator or control; outcome), commissioning of reviews, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and making recommendations. This method ensures a transparent link between the evidence and the recommendations. The GRADE system is a uniform, widely adopted approach based on explicit methods for formulating and evaluating the strength of recommendations for specific clinical questions on the basis of the robustness of the evidence. The GDG, co-chaired by Professor Fred Binka and Professor Nick White (other participants are listed below), organized a technical consultation on preparation of the third edition of the Guidelines. Declarations of conflicts of interest were received from all participants.A WHO Guideline Steering Group facilitated the scoping meeting, which was convened", "page_start": 285, "page_end": 285, "source": "WHO", "document": "B09514-eng.pdf"}

The GDG, co-chaired by Professor Fred Binka and Professor Nick White (other participants are listed below), organized a technical consultation on preparation of the third edition of the Guidelines. Declarations of conflicts of interest were received from all participants.A WHO Guideline Steering Group facilitated the scoping meeting, which was convened in February 2013, to set priorities and identify which sections of the second edition of the Guidelines were to be reviewed and to define potential new recommendations. Draft PICO questions were formulated for collation and review of the evidence. A review of data on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics was considered necessary to support dose recommendations, and a subgroup was formed for this purpose. After the scoping meeting, the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in Liverpool, United Kingdom, was commissioned to undertake systematic reviews and to assess the quality of the evidence for each priority question. The reviews involved extensive searches for published and unpublished reports of trials and highly sensitive searches of the Cochrane 285 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE®, Embase and LILACS. All the reviews have been published on line in the Cochrane Library. When insufficient evidence was available from randomized trials, published reviews of non-randomized studies were considered. The subgroup on dose recommendations reviewed published studies from MEDLINE® and Embase on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimalarial medicines. For analyses of pharmacokinetics and simulations of dosing, they used raw clinical and laboratory data from the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network on the concentrations of antimalarial agents in plasma orwhole blood measured with validated assays in individual patients. The data had either been included in peer-reviewed publications or been submitted to regulatory authorities for drug registration. Population pharmacokinetics models were constructed, and the plasma or whole blood concentration profiles of antimalarial medicines were simulated (typically 1000 times) for different weight categories. The GDG met in two technical meetings, in November 2013 and June 2014, to develop and finalize recommendations based on the GRADE tables constructed on the basis of answers to the PICO questions. The Guidelineswere written by a subcommittee of the group. At various times during preparation of the Guidelines, sections of the document or recommendations were reviewed by external experts and users who were not members of the group; these external peer reviewers are listed below.Treatment recommendations were agreed by consensus, supported by systematic reviews and review of information on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Areas of disagreement were discussed extensively to reach consensus; voting was not required. Members of the GDG - Professor K.I.

Mass drug administration should be implemented as a tool to accelerate elimination: against. Malaria Journal. 18:281. https://doi.org/10.1186/ s12936-019-2907-7. As the paper could be perceived as presenting a bias against implementation of MDA, Dr Mendis was recused from making judgments related to any of the MDA recommendations. Professor Melissa Penny declared financial research support her institute receives related to the overall topic of discussion on malaria elimination, and grants that she holds on the broader subject of malaria. It was determined that this interest does not present a conflict with respect to the meeting but would be disclosed to GDG members. Dr Allan Schapira reported that he is on the Board of Trustees of the UK-based charity, Malaria Consortium. It was determined that this interest does not present a conflict with respect to the meeting but would be disclosed to GDG members. Dr Chansuda Wongsrichanalai reported two interests, a paid consultancy to Medicines for Malaria Venture on radical therapy forP. vivaxand travel and per diem to attend internationalP. vivaxmeetings. It was determined that these interests do not present a conflict with respect to the meeting topics but would be disclosed to GDG members.

Inconsistency: serious.There is considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 92%, Chi2= 39.72 (p < 0.001)). However, this is largely explained by the difference in coverage in the included trials. Subgroup analysis for coverage ≥80%, <80% and ‘coverage not reported’ further clarifies the effect size. Note that coverage described here is the number of households with the appropriate number of spatial emanators. The 80% cutoff was chosen a priori as an estimate of full coverage and is not representative of a threshold for impact of the spatial emanators (see below).Imprecision: serious.Confidence intervals are wide (ranging from 903 fewer cases to 103 more cases for every 1000 participant years experienced). This may cross an important decision-making threshold and has crossed the null.

Two studies used DP alone; five studies used DP plus single low-dose primaquine; and one study used sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine/artesunate (SP+AS) plus a single dose of primaquine at 0.75 mg/kg. Most (5) studies conducted three rounds of MDA within one year; one study conducted four rounds of MDA over 15 months; one study conducted two rounds and one study conducted one round of MDA over a one-year period. Meta-analyses of the results showed reductions in prevalence and incidence ofP. falciparuminfection, but not clinical disease, 1–3 months after the last round of MDA. Multiple studies evaluated these outcomes at longer time periods but either no impact was found or the evidence was of very low certainty. Adverse events were often not measured in both arms, which complicated interpretation of the findings, but reported rates of adverse events or serious adverse events were low. Markers of artemisinin resistance were measured in only one study, which found no evidence of increases in drug-resistant parasites.

MDA to reduce transmission of P. vivax Clinical question/ PICO Population: Adults and children in a delimited geographical area with transmission of P. vivax Intervention: Mass drug administration (MDA) Comparator: no MDA Summary The systematic review identified five cRCTs and seven NRSs in eight countries (Cambodia, India, Kenya, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Panama, Solomon Islands, Venezuela [Bolivarian Republic of] and Viet Nam) assessing the impact of MDA onP. vivaxtransmission to no MDA (Schneideret alunpublished evidence). All of the cRCTs used DP and four of the studies also administered single low-dose primaquine, but none of the cRCTs used sufficient dosage of an 8-aminoquinoline to achieve radical cure ofP. vivaxhypnozoites1. One study provided a single round of MDA while the other four conducted three rounds of MDA. Among the NRSs, only one study reported radical cure ofP. vivax. There was more variability in the design of MDA among the NRSs with respect to drug regimens and number of rounds, ranging from a single round to 24 weekly rounds.

One study that contributed to the adverse events outcome (Comer 1971) considered its primaquine adult dosage regimen (40 mg of primaquine every two weeks for two years) to be radical cure, but as the total dose for an eight-week period (i.e. 160 mg) was less than 210 mg, the systematic review did not consider this to be radical cure.

Studies were conducted in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in 2002 and in the Republic of Azerbaijan in 1970–1971. Both studies provided primaquine for 14 days at 0.25 mg/kg per day, administered in a single round prior to the peak transmission season. Both studies reported decreases in the incidence ofP. vivax1–3 months after the start of the intervention but the risk of bias in the studies was considered very serious. Both studies found a decrease in the incidence ofP. vivax4–12 months after the intervention and one study reported a decrease in the prevalence ofP. vivaxduring that time period but the risk of bias in the studies was considered very serious.

Vaccines 385 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical question/ PICO Population: Children ≥5 months of age living in areas with endemic malaria transmission Intervention: A minimum of four doses of malaria vaccine (given as a three-dose initial series; first dose should be provided from around 5 months of age) with a minimum interval of four weeks between doses Comparator: Malaria interventions currently in place without malaria vaccination Summary Systematic review summary Six studies form the basis of these recommendations: five were individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one was an open- label extension study of an included RCT. One RCT was a multicentre study evaluating three or four doses of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine compared to no malaria vaccination. One RCT evaluated the seasonal administration of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine alone compared to SMC alone, and also compared a combination of malaria vaccine and SMC to either the malaria vaccine alone or SMC alone. One RCT was a single-site Phase 2b study evaluating the seasonal administration of the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine compared to no malaria vaccine in setting with highly seasonal malaria transmission where SMC was standard of care. One RCT was a multi-centre study evaluating age-based or seasonal vaccination of 4-doses of R21/Matrix-M compared to no malaria vaccination.

One RCT was a multi-centre study evaluating age-based or seasonal vaccination of 4-doses of R21/Matrix-M compared to no malaria vaccination. One RCT was an open-label Phase 2b study evaluating the efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 as a full, fractional and delayed dose regimen. Based on WHO regions, all five studies were conducted in Africa, specifically: Burkina Faso (five studies), Gabon, Ghana (two studies), Kenya (four studies), Malawi, Mali (two studies), Mozambique, and the United Republic of Tanzania (two studies). In addition, data from the observational evaluation during 46 months of pilot implementation in Ghana, Malawi, and Kenya were considered by SAGE/MPAG and included in the evidence summary. The RCTs showed that RTS,S/AS01 reduces clinical malaria episodes, hospital admissions with a positive malaria test, hospitalization with severe malaria, all-cause hospital admissions, severe malaria anaemia and the need for blood transfusions. Compared to SMC, RTS,S/AS01 is non-inferior in reducing clinical malaria and severe malaria anaemia and may be superior in reducing hospitalization with severe malaria. The combination of RTS,S/AS01 and SMC is probably better than SMC alone in reducing all-cause mortality and clinical malaria, and may reduce the need for blood transfusions and all-cause hospital admissions. The pilot programme showed that delivery of RTS,S/AS01 through routine systems probably reduces hospital admissions with severe malaria. The RCTs evaluating RTS,S/AS01 had too few cases to determine an association between the vaccine and meningitis, but the pilot study showed that RTS,S/AS01 introduction was probably not associated with an increase in hospital admissions with meningitis. There was uncertainty whether RTS,S/AS01 was associated with an increase in cerebral malaria in the RCTs, but the pilot programme showed that vaccine introduction was probably not associated with an increase in hospital admission with cerebral malaria. One RCT found that vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 may be associated with an increase in deaths in girls, but the other found no evidence that the effect of RTS,S/AS01 (alone or in combination with SMC) on mortality differed between girls and boys compared to SMC alone. The pilot programme found that the effect of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine introduction on all-cause mortality probably did not differ between girls and boys. The RCTs evaluating R21/Matrix-M showed that the vaccine reduces clinical malaria episodes using both age-based and seasonal vaccination approaches. Due to small sample size and too few events in the R21/Matrix-M RCTs, it was not possible to determine an association between vaccination and severe malaria, malaria hospital admissions or all-cause mortality. There was little to no difference between the R21/Matrix-M arm and the control arm in the number of blood transfusions and all-cause hospital admissions. Meningitis and cerebral malaria were included as adverse events of special interest (AESIs); both AESIs were uncommon and there was no imbalance between R21/Matrix-M and control arms.

The control group (R3C) received the comparator vaccine (Rabies vaccine) at months 0, 1, 2, and 20. Low transmission trial sites included Kilifi, Kenya and Korogwe, Tanzania. Moderate transmission trial sites included Lambarene, Gabon; Bagamoyo, Tanzania; Lilongwe, Malawi; and Manhica, Mozambique. High transmission trial sites included Siaya, Kenya; Nanoro, Burkina Faso; Kintampo, Burkina Faso; Kombewa, Kenya and Agogo, Ghana. 2. [174]. The number of cases averted over time was calculated as the sum of 3-monthly differences in the estimated number of cases between the control and the RTS,S/AS01 groups (R3R and R3C combined up to the time of 4th dose and R3R and R3C separately after the 4th dose) and expressed per 1000 participants vaccinated. In children, 1774 cases of clinical malaria were averted per 1000 children (95% CI 1387–2186) in the R3R group and 1363 per 1000 children (995–1797) in the R3C group. The numbers of cases averted per 1000 young infants were 983 (95% CI 592–1337) in the R3R group and 558 (158–926) in the R3C group. Among the older 402 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) children, in the 12 months following administration of the first three doses, protective efficacy against clinical (uncomplicated and severe) malaria was 51% (95% CI 47-55) (per protocol analysis). 3.

[177]. Absolute effect reported per 1000 children. In the R21 arm, there were 8 febrile convulsions amongst 3252 children. In the control arm, there was 1 febrile convulsion amongst 1626 children. A post-hoc analysis of clustering of febrile convulsions within 0-3 days of vaccination vs 4-28 days of vaccination shows the risk difference for the R21/Matrix-M arm is 0.00036 (0.000008 to 0.00071), p=0.004, 95% CI 2.0 to 67.1; risk difference for the control is 0.00016 (-0.00015 to 0.00047), p = 0.28; RI. The risk difference of 0.00036 translates to an attributable risk in the R21/Matrix-M arm of 1/2800 doses administered. This shows evidence of clustering of febrile convulsions in R21/Matrix-M (p=0.004) but not in the control (p=0.28). 131.

Across the three countries (Ghana, Kenya and Malawi), there were a total of 58,114 admissions to sentinel hospitals in children 1-59 months during the period from vaccine introduction until 12 July 2023: 14,461 were vaccine-eligible based on their date of birth out of 29,129 total admissions in areas where the vaccine was provided (implementation areas); 15,032 were vaccine-eligible out of 28,985 total admissions in comparison areas. 138.

There were 418 cases of cerebral malaria among children age-eligible to receive at least one dose of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine: 197 from implementation areas and 221 from comparison areas. Among children not age-eligible to receive the malaria vaccine, there were 576 cases of cerebral malaria: 282 from implementation areas and 294 from comparison areas. The incidence rate ratio comparing rates of admission to hospital with cerebral malaria in implementation areas relative to comparison areas, among children eligible for the malaria vaccine, was 0.94 (95%CI 0.63 to 1.39). The incidence rate ratio for admission with other forms of severe malaria excluding cerebral malaria was 0.80 (95%CI 0.63 to 1.00). There was no evidence that effectiveness differed between cerebral malaria and other forms of severe malaria (relative rate ratio 1.09 [95%CI 0.72 to 1.63] and test for interaction p-value: 0.688). When the analysis was restricted to include cases meeting the criteria for cerebral malaria for whom lumbar puncture was performed, there was a total of 172 cases in age-groups eligible to have received at least one dose of the malaria vaccine: 129 from implementation areas and 143 from comparison areas. There were 318 cases in non-eligible age groups: 151 from implementing areas and 167 from comparison areas. The incidence rate ratio comparing rates of admission to hospital with cerebral malaria (with the strict case definition) in implementation areas relative to comparison areas, among children eligible for the malaria vaccine, was 1.25 (95%CI 0.84 to 1.88).

[Safety outcome] Pilot implementation study designed to be analysed using cluster randomized control methodology. The evaluation was not powered at this time point to assess the overall impact of vaccine introduction on mortality, but the evaluation was well powered to detect gender imbalance in all-cause mortality of the magnitude observed in the Phase 3 trial (mortality ratio = 1.4--1.6), in children up to about 2 years of age. A total of 15,444 deaths among children 1-59 months of age were reported via community-based mortality surveillance across the three countries (Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi) from the start of vaccinations on 23 April 2019 to 12 July 2023 (deaths in April 2021 were excluded because verbal autopsies had not all been completed). 168. [195]. There was no evidence that the effect of RTS,S/AS01 introduction on all-cause mortality differed between girls and boys in this age group. Excluding deaths due to injury in children eligible to have received 3 doses of RTS,S/AS01, there was a total of 11,992 deaths reported: 5,706 from implementing regions and 6,286 from comparison regions. In children who were not eligible to have received the vaccine, there were 7,534 deaths in implementing regions and 7,044 in comparison regions. The mortality ratio in the vaccine-eligible age group (eligible for 3 doses) between implementing and comparison regions, was 0.87 (95%CI: 0.78 to 0.97), a reduction of 13% (95%CI: 3% to 22%). There was no evidence that the mortality ratio differed between girls and boys (p-value for 412 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) interaction 0.981).

No difference at any time between participants receiving primaquine and those that not did not. We present the data for day 43 in this table. 8. Indirectness: very serious.The percentage of people with large drops in haemoglobin, not the mean change in the population, is the important safety outcome, and the estimates are averages in a small population (N = 99) that includes people with normal G6PD function.

These summary estimates were based on the CareStart G6PD qualitative test (Access Bio, Inc.) as the majority of evaluation studies included this test (at least 10 of 19 studies). Only four studies evaluated the fluorescent spot test (FST). Clinical question/ PICO Population: Patients with malaria undergoing G6PD testing to inform treatment with primaquine or tafenoquine to prevent relapses of P. vivax and P. ovale Intervention: Semi-quantitative near-patient tests for G6PD Comparator: Quality-assured G6PD spectrophotometric assay Summary Key question In patients undergoing G6PD activity testing, how accurate are semi-quantitative near-patient tests for G6PD deficiency compared to quantitative spectrophotometric G6PD testing at the thresholds of 30% and 70% of normal G6PD activity, critical to informing administration of specific regimens of 8-aminoquinolines to prevent relapses ofP. vivaxandP. ovale? PIRT - Patientswith malaria who undergoing G6PD testing to inform treatment with primaquine or tafenoquine to prevent relapses ofP. vivaxandP. ovale. - Index testis semi-quantitative near-patient tests for G6PD. - Reference standardis the quality assured G6PD spectrophotometric assay using the adjusted male median (AMM) as the standardised metric of 100% G6PD activity. For the Standard G6PD biosensor used with the STANDARD G6PD Analyzer (SB Biosensor, Inc) a supplementary analysis was performed using manufacturer references to calculate relevant thresholds. - Target conditions: true positives, false positives, false negatives and true negatives; the overall aim of testing is to prevent severe haemolysis due to tafenoquine or high daily primaquine intake in case of G6PD deficient patients (<30% and ≥ 70% of normal G6PD activity).

Evidence synthesis The Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) assembled the review following the steps and activities below: Tafenoquine (single dose) - The existing published Cochrane Review of Tafenoquine for preventing relapse in people withPlasmodium vivaxmalaria (search date June 2020) was updated. This update identified no further published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relating to efficacy and safety. - An additional systematic review was performed of all study types relating to efficacy, safety, feasibility, and cost of tafenoquine up to search date 1 August 2023. Search methods For each systematic review, the following databases were searched up to 31 July 2023 (for RCT review) and 01 August 2023 (for review of all study types): the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library, Issue 7 of 12, July 2023; MEDLINE (OVID, from 1946); Embase (OVID, from 1947); WHO Global Index Medicus; Science Citation index-Expanded (Web of Science, from 1900). The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (who.int/ictrp/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home), and the ISRCTN registry (isrctn.com/) were searched to identify trials in progress. Synthesizing results Two review authors independently assessed the literature search results. Included studies were described, assessed, and data presented.

However, there was a small reduction of the incidence of clinical malaria found in two studies. The certainty of evidence from the NRSs was GRADEd as very low.

Two studies conducted in post-elimination settings identified imported infections in migrant workers with onward transmission to the local population. In both studies, the migrant workers were provided with a full therapeutic dose of chloroquine and 14 days of primaquine in a single round (the study from Greece conducted one round per year for three years). No additional infections among the migrant workers or the community were identified for five months (Sri Lanka) or two years (Greece) after the last round of TDA.

No studies were conducted in very low to low transmission or post-elimination settings. The GDG determined that the TTaT strategy would be most relevant in very low to low transmission or post-elimination settings and, therefore, decided that the PICO question should be modified and the setting limited to such areas. As a result, the GDG did not consider any of the studies identified by the systematic review to fit the revised PICO.

Evidence of low to moderate certainty from the cRCTs suggested that RDA may reduce malaria prevalence and incidence slightly but probably results in little to no difference in the incidence of clinical malaria.

Reactive indoor residual spraying Clinical question/ PICO Population: Adults and children residing with or near a confirmed malaria case in areas nearing elimination or in post- elimination settings Intervention: Reactive indoor residual spraying Comparator: no Reactive IRS Summary The systematic review identified two cRCTs in Namibia and South Africa (Gimniget alunpublished evidence). The study from Namibia (superiority trial design) was conducted as a 2x2 factorial design with RACDT alone, RDA alone, RACDT plus RIRS, and 474 of 478 WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) RDA plus RIRS. The study from South Africa was designed as a non-inferiority trial comparing RIRS to standard IRS (used in defined priority areas) that reached one third of houses. The results below report the absolute effects (risk differences) of the intervention, as these were used by the GDG in its judgements; relative effect sizes are available in the Research evidence. Beneficial outcomes - RIRS results in a large reduction in the prevalence of malaria (RD: -27 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -35 to -8 per 1000 persons; one cRCT [superiority design]; high-certainty evidence). - RIRS may reduce the incidence of clinical malaria. However, the effects of RIRS on clinical malaria vary and it is possible that RIRS makes little or no difference (RD: -14 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -32 to 4 per 1000 p-y; one cRCT [superiority design]; moderate-certainty evidence). - RIRS probably results in little to no difference in incidence of clinical malaria (mean difference: 0.1 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -0.38 to 0.59 per 1000 p-y; one cRCT [non-inferiority design]; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse events - RIRS results in little to no difference in reported adverse events (RD: 2 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -2 to 1 per 1000 persons; one cRCT [superiority design]; high-certainty evidence). - RIRS results in little to no difference in serious adverse events (deaths) (one cRCT [non-inferiority design]; high-certainty evidence).

This document supercedes the relevant sections contained in the 1985 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Guideline for Handwashing and Environmental Control. 1 Because maximum effectiveness from disinfection and sterilization results from first cleaning and removing organic and inorganic materials, this document also reviews cleaning methods. The chemical disinfectants discussed for patient-care equipment include alcohols, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, ortho-phthalaldehyde, peracetic acid, phenolics, quaternary ammonium compounds, and chlorine. The choice of disinfectant, concentration, and exposure time is based on the risk for infection associated with use of the equipment and other factors discussed in this guideline. The sterilization methods discussed include steam sterilization, ethylene oxide (ETO), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid peracetic acid. When properly used, these cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization processes can reduce the risk for infection associated with use of invasive and noninvasive medical and surgical devices. However, for these processes to be effective, health-care workers should adhere strictly to the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization recommendations in this document and to instructions on product labels. In addition to updated recommendations, new topics addressed in this guideline include 1. inactivation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, bioterrorist agents, emerging pathogens, and bloodborne", "page_start": 7, "page_end": 8, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

In addition to updated recommendations, new topics addressed in this guideline include 1. inactivation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, bioterrorist agents, emerging pathogens, and bloodborne pathogens; 2. toxicologic, environmental, and occupational concerns associated with disinfection and sterilization practices; 3. disinfection of patient-care equipment used in ambulatory settings and home care; 4. new sterilization processes, such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and liquid peracetic acid; and 5. disinfection of complex medical instruments (e.g., endoscopes). Last update: June 2024 8 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Introduction In the United States, approximately 46.5 million surgical procedures and even more invasive medical procedures—including approximately 5 million gastrointestinal endoscopies—are performed each year. 2 Each procedure involves contact by a medical device or surgical instrument with a patient’s sterile tissue or mucous membranes. A major risk of all such procedures is the introduction of pathogens that can lead to infection. Failure to properly disinfect or sterilize equipment carries not only risk associated with breach of host barriers but also risk for person-to-person transmission (e.g., hepatitis B virus) and transmission of environmental pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Disinfection and sterilization are essential for ensuring that medical and surgical instruments do not transmit infectious pathogens to patients. Because sterilization of all patient-care items is not necessary, health-care policies must identify, primarily on the basis of the items' intended use, whether cleaning, disinfection, or sterilization is indicated. Multiple studies in many countries have documented lack of compliance with established guidelines for disinfection and sterilization. 3-6 Failure to comply with scientifically-based guidelines has led to numerous outbreaks. 6-12 This guideline presents a pragmatic approach to the judicious selection and proper use of disinfection and sterilization processes; the approach is based on well-designed studies assessing the efficacy (through laboratory investigations) and effectiveness (through clinical studies) of disinfection and sterilization procedures. Methods This guideline resulted from a review of all MEDLINE articles in English listed under the MeSH headings of disinfection or sterilization (focusing on health-care equipment and supplies) from January 1980 through August 2006. References listed in these articles also were reviewed. Selected articles published before 1980 were reviewed and, if still relevant, included in the guideline. The three major peer- reviewed journals in infection control—American Journal of Infection Control, Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, and Journal of Hospital Infection—were searched for relevant articles published from January 1990 through August 2006. Abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and Association for professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. during 1997–2006 also were reviewed; however, abstracts were not used to support the recommendations.

Abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and Association for professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. during 1997–2006 also were reviewed; however, abstracts were not used to support the recommendations. Definition of Terms Sterilization describes a process that destroys or eliminates all forms of microbial life and is carried out in health-care facilities by physical or chemical methods. Steam under pressure, dry heat, EtO gas, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid chemicals are the principal sterilizing agents used in health- care facilities. Sterilization is intended to convey an absolute meaning; unfortunately, however, some health professionals and the technical and commercial literature refer to “disinfection” as “sterilization” and items as “partially sterile.” When chemicals are used to destroy all forms of microbiologic life, they can be called chemical sterilants. These same germicides used for shorter exposure periods also can be part of the disinfection process (i.e., high-level disinfection). Disinfection describes a process that eliminates many or all pathogenic microorganisms, except bacterial spores, on inanimate objects (Tables 1 and 2). In health-care settings, objects usually are disinfected by liquid chemicals or wet pasteurization. Each of the various factors that affect the efficacy of Last update: June 2024 9 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) disinfection can nullify or limit the efficacy of the process. Factors that affect the efficacy of both disinfection and sterilization include prior cleaning of the object; organic and inorganic load present; type and level of microbial contamination; concentration of and exposure time to the germicide; physical nature of the object (e.g., crevices, hinges, and lumens); presence of biofilms; temperature and pH of the disinfection process; and in some cases, relative humidity of the sterilization process (e.g., ethylene oxide). Unlike sterilization, disinfection is not sporicidal. A few disinfectants will kill spores with prolonged exposure times (3–12 hours); these are called chemical sterilants. At similar concentrations but with shorter exposure periods (e.g., 20 minutes for 2% glutaraldehyde), these same disinfectants will kill all microorganisms except large numbers of bacterial spores; they are called high-level disinfectants. Low- level disinfectants can kill most vegetative bacteria, some fungi, and some viruses in a practical period of time (≤10 minutes). Intermediate-level disinfectants might be cidal for mycobacteria, vegetative bacteria, most viruses, and most fungi but do not necessarily kill bacterial spores. Germicides differ markedly, primarily in their antimicrobial spectrum and rapidity of action. Cleaning is the removal of visible soil (e.g., organic and inorganic material) from objects and surfaces and normally is accomplished manually or mechanically using water with detergents or enzymatic products. Thorough cleaning is essential before high-level disinfection and sterilization because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of instruments interfere with the effectiveness of these processes. Decontamination removes pathogenic microorganisms from objects so they are safe", "page_start": 9, "page_end": 10, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

Thorough cleaning is essential before high-level disinfection and sterilization because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of instruments interfere with the effectiveness of these processes. Decontamination removes pathogenic microorganisms from objects so they are safe to handle, use, or discard. Terms with the suffix cide or cidal for killing action also are commonly used. For example, a germicide is an agent that can kill microorganisms, particularly pathogenic organisms (“germs”). The term germicide includes both antiseptics and disinfectants. Antiseptics are germicides applied to living tissue and skin; disinfectants are antimicrobials applied only to inanimate objects. In general, antiseptics are used only on the skin and not for surface disinfection, and disinfectants are not used for skin antisepsis because they can injure skin and other tissues. Virucide, fungicide, bactericide, sporicide, and tuberculocide can kill the type of microorganism identified by the prefix. For example, a bactericide is an agent that kills bacteria. 13-18 Last update: June 2024 10 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) A Rational Approach to Disinfection and Sterilization More than 30 years ago, Earle H. Spaulding devised a rational approach to disinfection and sterilization of patient-care items and equipment.14 This classification scheme is so clear and logical that it has been retained, refined, and successfully used by infection control professionals and others when planning methods for disinfection or sterilization. 1, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20 Spaulding believed the nature of disinfection could be understood readily if instruments and items for patient care were categorized as critical, semicritical, and noncritical according to the degree of risk for infection involved in use of the items. The CDC Guideline for Handwashing and Hospital Environmental Control 21, Guidelines for the Prevention of Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) to Health-Care and Public-Safety Workers22, and Guideline for Environmental Infection Control in Health- Care Facilities23 employ this terminology. Critical Items Critical items confer a high risk for infection if they are contaminated with any microorganism. Thus, objects that enter sterile tissue or the vascular system must be sterile because any microbial contamination could transmit disease. This category includes surgical instruments, cardiac and urinary catheters, implants, and ultrasound probes used in sterile body cavities. Most of the items in this category should be purchased as sterile or be sterilized with steam if possible. Heat-sensitive objects can be treated with EtO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma; or if other methods are unsuitable, by liquid chemical sterilants. Germicides categorized as chemical sterilants include ≥2.4% glutaraldehyde-based formulations, 0.95% glutaraldehyde with 1.64% phenol/phenate, 7.5% stabilized hydrogen peroxide, 7.35% hydrogen peroxide with 0.23% peracetic acid, 0.2% peracetic acid, and 0.08% peracetic acid with 1.0% hydrogen peroxide.

Liquid chemical sterilants reliably produce sterility only if cleaning precedes treatment and if proper guidelines are followed regarding concentration, contact time, temperature, and pH. Semicritical Items Semicritical items contact mucous membranes or nonintact skin. This category includes respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipment, some endoscopes, laryngoscope blades 24, esophageal manometry probes, cystoscopes 25, anorectal manometry catheters, and diaphragm fitting rings. These medical devices should be free from all microorganisms; however, small numbers of bacterial spores are permissible. Intact mucous membranes, such as those of the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract, generally are resistant to infection by common bacterial spores but susceptible to other organisms, such as bacteria, mycobacteria, and viruses. Semicritical items minimally require high-level disinfection using chemical disinfectants. Glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, ortho-phthalaldehyde, and peracetic acid with hydrogen peroxide are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are dependable high- level disinfectants provided the factors influencing germicidal procedures are met (Table 1). When a disinfectant is selected for use with certain patient-care items, the chemical compatibility after extended use with the items to be disinfected also must be considered. High-level disinfection traditionally is defined as complete elimination of all microorganisms in or on an instrument, except for small numbers of bacterial spores. The FDA definition of high-level disinfection is a sterilant used for a shorter contact time to achieve a 6-log10 kill of an appropriate Mycobacterium species. Cleaning followed by high-level disinfection should eliminate enough pathogens to prevent transmission of infection. 26, 27 Laparoscopes and arthroscopes entering sterile tissue ideally should be sterilized between patients. However, in the United States, this equipment sometimes undergoes only high-level disinfection between patients. 28-30 As with flexible endoscopes, these devices can be difficult to clean and high-level disinfect Last update: June 2024 11 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) or sterilize because of intricate device design (e.g., long narrow lumens, hinges). Meticulous cleaning must precede any high-level disinfection or sterilization process. Although sterilization is preferred, no reports have been published of outbreaks resulting from high-level disinfection of these scopes when they are properly cleaned and high-level disinfected. Newer models of these instruments can withstand steam sterilization that for critical items would be preferable to high-level disinfection. Rinsing endoscopes and flushing channels with sterile water, filtered water, or tap water will prevent adverse effects associated with disinfectant retained in the endoscope (e.g., disinfectant-induced colitis). Items can be rinsed and flushed using sterile water after high-level disinfection to prevent contamination with organisms in tap water, such as nontuberculous mycobacteria, 10, 31, 32 Legionella, 33-35 or gram- negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas.", "page_start": 11, "page_end": 12, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

Some items that may come in contact with nonintact skin for a brief period of time (i.e., hydrotherapy tanks, bed side rails) are usually considered noncritical surfaces and are disinfected with intermediate- level disinfectants (i.e., phenolic, iodophor, alcohol, chlorine) 23. Since hydrotherapy tanks have been associated with spread of infection, some facilities have chosen to disinfect them with recommended levels of chlorine 23, 41. In the past, high-level disinfection was recommended for mouthpieces and spirometry tubing (e.g., glutaraldehyde) but cleaning the interior surfaces of the spirometers was considered unnecessary. 42 This was based on a study that showed that mouthpieces and spirometry tubing become contaminated with microorganisms but there was no bacterial contamination of the surfaces inside the spirometers. Filters have been used to prevent contamination of this equipment distal to the filter; such filters and the proximal mouthpiece are changed between patients. Noncritical Items Noncritical items are those that come in contact with intact skin but not mucous membranes. Intact skin acts as an effective barrier to most microorganisms; therefore, the sterility of items coming in contact with intact skin is \"not critical.\" In this guideline, noncritical items are divided into noncritical patient care items and noncritical environmental surfaces 43, 44. Examples of noncritical patient-care items are bedpans, blood pressure cuffs, crutches and computers 45. In contrast to critical and some semicritical items, most noncritical reusable items may be decontaminated where they are used and do not need to be transported to a central processing area. Virtually no risk has been documented for transmission of infectious agents to patients through noncritical items 37 when they are used as noncritical items and do not contact non-intact skin and/or mucous membranes. Table 1 lists several low-level disinfectants that may be used for noncritical items. Most Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered disinfectants have a 10-minute label claim. However, multiple investigators have demonstrated the effectiveness of these disinfectants against vegetative bacteria (e.g., Listeria, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), yeasts (e.g., Candida), mycobacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and viruses (e.g. poliovirus) at exposure times of 30–60 seconds46-64 Federal law requires all applicable label instructions on EPA-registered products to be", "page_start": 12, "page_end": 12, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

If the user selects exposure conditions (e.g., exposure time) that differ from those on the EPA-registered products label, the user assumes liability for any injuries resulting from off- label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) 65. Noncritcal environmental surfaces include bed rails, some food utensils, bedside tables, patient furniture and floors. Noncritical environmental surfaces frequently touched by hand (e.g., bedside tables, Last update: June 2024 12 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) bed rails) potentially could contribute to secondary transmission by contaminating hands of health-care workers or by contacting medical equipment that subsequently contacts patients 13, 46-48, 51, 66, 67. Mops and reusable cleaning cloths are regularly used to achieve low-level disinfection on environmental surfaces. However, they often are not adequately cleaned and disinfected, and if the water-disinfectant mixture is not changed regularly (e.g., after every three to four rooms, at no longer than 60-minute intervals), the mopping procedure actually can spread heavy microbial contamination throughout the health-care facility 68.In one study, standard laundering provided acceptable decontamination of heavily contaminated mopheads but chemical disinfection with a phenolic was less effective. 68 Frequent laundering of mops (e.g., daily), therefore, is recommended. Single-use disposable towels impregnated with a disinfectant also can be used for low-level disinfection when spot-cleaning of noncritical surfaces is needed45. Changes in Disinfection and Sterilization Since 1981 The Table in the CDC Guideline for Environmental Control prepared in 1981 as a guide to the appropriate selection and use of disinfectants has undergone several important changes (Table 1).15 First, formaldehyde-alcohol has been deleted as a recommended chemical sterilant or high-level disinfectant because it is irritating and toxic and not commonly used. Second, several new chemical sterilants have been added, including hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid 58, 69, 70, and peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in combination. Third, 3% phenolics and iodophors have been deleted as high-level disinfectants because of their unproven efficacy against bacterial spores, M. tuberculosis, and/or some fungi. 55, 71 Fourth, isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol have been excluded as high-level disinfectants 15 because of their inability to inactivate bacterial spores and because of the inability of isopropyl alcohol to inactivate hydrophilic viruses (i.e., poliovirus, coxsackie virus).72 Fifth, a 1:16 dilution of 2.0% glutaraldehyde-7.05% phenol-1.20% sodium phenate (which contained 0.125% glutaraldehyde, 0.440% phenol, and 0.075% sodium phenate when diluted) has been deleted as a high-level disinfectant because this product was removed from", "page_start": 12, "page_end": 13, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

These include inactivation of emerging pathogens, bioterrorist agents, and bloodborne pathogens; toxicologic, environmental, and occupational concerns associated with disinfection and sterilization practices; disinfection of patient-care equipment used in ambulatory and home care; inactivation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; new sterilization processes, such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and liquid peracetic acid; and disinfection of complex medical instruments (e.g., endoscopes). Last update: June 2024 13 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Disinfection of Healthcare Equipment Concerns about Implementing the Spaulding Scheme One problem with implementing the aforementioned scheme is oversimplification. For example, the scheme does not consider problems with reprocessing of complicated medical equipment that often is heat-sensitive or problems of inactivating certain types of infectious agents (e.g., prions, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD] agent). Thus, in some situations, choosing a method of disinfection remains difficult, even after consideration of the categories of risk to patients. This is true particularly for a few medical devices (e.g., arthroscopes, laparoscopes) in the critical category because of controversy about whether they should be sterilized or high-level disinfected. 28, 86 Heat-stable scopes (e.g., many rigid scopes) should be steam sterilized. Some of these items cannot be steam sterilized because they are heat-sensitive; additionally, sterilization using ethylene oxide (EtO) can be too time-consuming for routine use between patients (new technologies, such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and peracetic acid reprocessor, provide faster cycle times). However, evidence that sterilization of these items improves patient care by reducing the infection risk is lacking29, 87-91. Many newer models of these instruments can withstand steam sterilization, which for critical items is the preferred method. Another problem with implementing the Spaulding scheme is processing of an instrument in the semicritical category (e.g., endoscope) that would be used in conjunction with a critical instrument that contacts sterile body tissues.

Another problem with implementing the Spaulding scheme is processing of an instrument in the semicritical category (e.g., endoscope) that would be used in conjunction with a critical instrument that contacts sterile body tissues. For example, is an endoscope used for upper gastrointestinal tract investigation still a semicritical item when used with sterile biopsy forceps or in a patient who is bleeding heavily from esophageal varices? Provided that high-level disinfection is achieved, and all microorganisms except bacterial spores have been removed from the endoscope, the device should not represent an infection risk and should remain in the semicritical category 92-94 . Infection with spore-forming bacteria has not been reported from appropriately high-level disinfected endoscopes. An additional problem with implementation of the Spaulding system is that the optimal contact time for high-level disinfection has not been defined or varies among professional organizations, resulting in different strategies for disinfecting different types of semicritical items (e.g., endoscopes, applanation tonometers, endocavitary transducers, cryosurgical instruments, and diaphragm fitting rings). Until simpler and effective alternatives are identified for device disinfection in clinical settings, following this guideline, other CDC guidelines 1, 22, 95, 96 and FDA-cleared instructions for the liquid chemical sterilants/high-level disinfectants would be prudent. Reprocessing of Endoscopes Physicians use endoscopes to diagnose and treat numerous medical disorders. Even though endoscopes represent a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic tool in modern medicine and the incidence of infection associated with their use reportedly is very low (about 1 in 1.8 million procedures) 97, more healthcare–associated outbreaks have been linked to contaminated endoscopes than to any other medical device 6-8, 12, 98. To prevent the spread of health-care–associated infections, all heat-sensitive endoscopes (e.g., gastrointestinal endoscopes, bronchoscopes, nasopharygoscopes) must be properly cleaned and, at a minimum, subjected to high-level disinfection after each use. High-level disinfection can be expected to destroy all microorganisms, although when high numbers of bacterial spores are present, a few spores might survive. Because of the types of body cavities they enter, flexible endoscopes acquire high levels of microbial contamination (bioburden) during each use 99. For example, the bioburden found on flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes after use has ranged from 105 colony forming units (CFU)/mL to 1010 CFU/mL, with the highest levels found in the suction channels 99-102. The average load on bronchoscopes before cleaning was 6.4x104 CFU/mL. Cleaning reduces the level of microbial contamination by 4–6 log10 83, 103. Using human immunovirus (HIV)-contaminated endoscopes, several investigators have shown that cleaning completely eliminates the microbial contamination on the scopes 104, 105. Similarly, other investigators found that EtO sterilization or soaking in 2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes was effective only when the device first was properly cleaned 106.

At this time, the FDA-cleared and marketed formulations include: ≥2.4% glutaraldehyde, 0.55% ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), 0.95% glutaraldehyde with 1.64% phenol/phenate, 7.35% hydrogen peroxide with 0.23% peracetic acid, 1.0% hydrogen peroxide with 0.08% peracetic acid, and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide 85. These products have excellent antimicrobial activity; however, some oxidizing chemicals (e.g., 7.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 1.0% hydrogen peroxide with 0.08% peracetic acid [latter product is no longer marketed]) reportedly have caused cosmetic and functional damage to endoscopes 69. Users should check with device manufacturers for information about germicide compatibility with their device. If the germicide is FDA-cleared, then it is safe when used according to label directions; however, professionals should review the scientific literature for newly available data regarding human safety or materials compatibility. EtO sterilization of flexible endoscopes is infrequent because it requires a lengthy processing and aeration time (e.g., 12 hours) and is a potential hazard to staff and patients. The two products most commonly used for reprocessing endoscopes in the United States are glutaraldehyde and an automated, liquid chemical sterilization process that uses peracetic acid 107. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) recommends glutaraldehyde solutions that do not contain surfactants because the soapy residues of surfactants are difficult to remove during rinsing 108. ortho-phthalaldehyde has begun to replace glutaraldehyde in many health-care facilities because it has several potential advantages over glutaraldehyde: is not known to irritate the eyes and nasal passages, does not require activation or exposure monitoring, and has a 12-minute high-level disinfection claim in the United States 69. Disinfectants that are not FDA-cleared and should not be used for reprocessing endoscopes include iodophors, chlorine solutions, alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, and phenolics. These solutions might still be in use outside the United States, but their use should be strongly discouraged because of lack of proven efficacy against all microorganisms or materials incompatibility.

Manufacturers test the product under worst-case conditions for germicide formulation (i.e., minimum recommended concentration of the active ingredient), and include organic soil. Typically manufacturers use 5% serum as the organic soil and hard water as examples of organic and inorganic challenges. The soil represents the organic loading to which the device is exposed during actual use and that would remain on the device in the absence of cleaning. This method ensures that the contact conditions completely eliminate the test mycobacteria (e.g., 105 to 106 Mycobacteria tuberculosis in organic soil and dried on a scope) if inoculated in the most difficult areas for the disinfectant to penetrate and contact in the absence of cleaning and thus provides a margin of safety 109. For 2.4% glutaraldehyde that requires a 45-minute immersion at 25oC to achieve high-level disinfection (i.e., 100% kill of M. tuberculosis). FDA itself does not conduct testing but relies solely on the disinfectant manufacturer’s data. Data suggest that M. tuberculosis levels can be reduced by at least 8 log10 with cleaning (4 log10) 83, 101, 102, 110, followed by chemical disinfection for 20 minutes at 20°C (4 to 6 log10) 83, 93, 111, 112. On the basis of these data, APIC 113, the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates (SGNA) 38, 114, 115, the ASGE 108, American College of Chest Physicians 12, and a multi-society guideline 116 recommend alternative contact conditions with 2% glutaraldehyde to achieve high-level disinfection (e.g., that equipment be immersed in 2% glutaraldehyde at 20°C for at least 20 minutes for high-level disinfection). Federal regulations are to follow the FDA-cleared label claim for high-level disinfectants. The FDA-cleared labels for high-level disinfection with >2% glutaraldehyde at 25°C range from 20-90 minutes, depending upon the product based on three tier testing which includes AOAC sporicidal tests, simulated use testing with mycobacterial and in-use testing. The studies supporting the efficacy of >2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes at 20oC assume adequate cleaning prior to disinfection, whereas the FDA-cleared label claim incorporates an Last update: June 2024 15 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) added margin of safety to accommodate possible lapses in cleaning practices.

Flexible endoscopes are particularly difficult to disinfect 122 and easy to damage because of their intricate design and delicate materials. 123 Meticulous cleaning must precede any sterilization or high-level disinfection of these instruments. Failure to perform good cleaning can result in sterilization or disinfection failure, and outbreaks of infection can occur. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of cleaning in experimental studies with the duck hepatitis B virus (HBV) 106, 124, HIV 125and Helicobacter pylori. 126 An examination of health-care–associated infections related only to endoscopes through July 1992 found 281 infections transmitted by gastrointestinal endoscopy and 96 transmitted by bronchoscopy. The clinical spectrum ranged from asymptomatic colonization to death. Salmonella species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa repeatedly were identified as causative agents of infections transmitted by gastrointestinal endoscopy, and M. tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, and P. aeruginosa were the most common causes of infections transmitted by bronchoscopy 12. Major reasons for transmission were inadequate cleaning, improper selection of a disinfecting agent, and failure to follow recommended cleaning and disinfection procedures 6, 8, 37, 98, and flaws in endoscope design 127, 128 or automated endoscope reprocessors. 7, 98 Failure to follow established guidelines has continued to result in infections associated with gastrointestinal endoscopes 8 and bronchoscopes 7, 12. Potential device-associated problems should be reported to the FDA Center for Devices and Radiologic Health. One multistate investigation found that 23.9% of the bacterial cultures from the internal channels of 71 gastrointestinal endoscopes grew ≥100,000 colonies of bacteria after completion of all disinfection and sterilization procedures (nine of 25 facilities were using a product that has been removed from the marketplace [six facilities using 1:16 glutaraldehyde phenate], is not FDA-cleared as a high-level disinfectant [an iodophor] or no disinfecting agent) and before use on the next patient129. The incidence of postendoscopic procedure infections from an improperly processed endoscope has not been rigorously assessed. Automated endoscope reprocessors (AER) offer several advantages over manual reprocessing: they automate and standardize several important reprocessing steps130-132, reduce the likelihood that an essential reprocessing step will be skipped, and reduce personnel exposure to high-level disinfectants or chemical sterilants. Failure of AERs has been linked to outbreaks of infections 133 or colonization 7, 134, and the AER water filtration system might not be able to reliably provide “sterile” or bacteria-free rinse water135, 136.Establishment of correct connectors between the AER and the device is critical to ensure complete flow of disinfectants and rinse water 7, 137.

In addition, some endoscopes such as the duodenoscopes (e.g., endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]) contain features (e.g., elevator-wire channel) that require a flushing pressure that is not achieved by most AERs and must be reprocessed manually using a 2- to 5-mL syringe, until new duodenoscopes equipped with a wider elevator-channel that AERs can reliably reprocess become available 132. Outbreaks involving removable endoscope parts 138, 139 such as suction valves and endoscopic accessories designed to be inserted through flexible endoscopes such as biopsy forceps emphasize the importance of cleaning to remove all foreign matter before high-level disinfection or sterilization. 140 Some types of valves are now available as single-use, disposable products (e.g., bronchoscope valves) or steam sterilizable products (e.g., gastrointestinal endoscope valves). AERs need further development and redesign 7, 141, as do endoscopes 123, 142, so that they do not represent a potential source of infectious agents. Endoscopes employing disposable components (e.g., protective barrier devices or sheaths) might provide an alternative to conventional liquid chemical high- level disinfection/sterilization143, 144. Another new technology is a swallowable camera-in-a-capsule that travels through the digestive tract and transmits color pictures of the small intestine to a receiver worn outside the body. This capsule currently does not replace colonoscopies. Last update: June 2024 16 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Published recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting endoscopic equipment should be strictly followed 12, 38, 108, 113-116, 145-148. Unfortunately, audits have shown that personnel do not consistently adhere to guidelines on reprocessing 149-151 and outbreaks of infection continue to occur. 152-154 To ensure reprocessing personnel are properly trained, each person who reprocesses endoscopic instruments should receive initial and annual competency testing 38, 155. In general, endoscope disinfection or sterilization with a liquid chemical sterilant involves five steps after leak testing: 1. Clean: mechanically clean internal and external surfaces, including brushing internal channels and flushing each internal channel with water and a detergent or enzymatic cleaners (leak testing is recommended for endoscopes before immersion). 2. Disinfect: immerse endoscope in high-level disinfectant (or chemical sterilant) and perfuse (eliminates air pockets and ensures contact of the germicide with the internal channels) disinfectant into all accessible channels, such as the suction/biopsy channel and air/water channel and expose for a time recommended for specific products. 3. Rinse: rinse the endoscope and all channels with sterile water, filtered water (commonly used with AERs) or tap water (i.e., high-quality potable water that meets federal clean water standards at the point of use). 4.

Dry: rinse the insertion tube and inner channels with alcohol, and dry with forced air after disinfection and before storage. 5. Store: store the endoscope in a way that prevents recontamination and promotes drying (e.g., hung vertically). Drying the endoscope (steps 3 and 4) is essential to greatly reduce the chance of recontamination of the endoscope by microorganisms that can be present in the rinse water 116, 156. One study demonstrated that reprocessed endoscopes (i.e., air/water channel, suction/biopsy channel) generally were negative (100% after 24 hours; 90% after 7 days [1 CFU of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in one channel]) for bacterial growth when stored by hanging vertically in a ventilated cabinet157. Other investigators found all endoscopes were bacteria-free immediately after high-level disinfection, and only four of 135 scopes were positive during the subsequent 5-day assessment (skin bacteria cultured from endoscope surfaces). All flush-through samples remained sterile 158. Because tapwater can contain low levels of microorganisms159, some researchers have suggested that only sterile water (which can be prohibitively expensive) 160 or AER filtered water be used. The suggestion to use only sterile water or filtered water is not consistent with published guidelines that allow tapwater with an alcohol rinse and forced air-drying 38, 108, 113 or the scientific literature. 39, 93 In addition, no evidence of disease transmission has been found when a tap water rinse is followed by an alcohol rinse and forced-air drying. AERs produce filtered water by passage through a bacterial filter (e.g., 0.2 μ). Filtered rinse water was identified as a source of bacterial contamination in a study that cultured the accessory and suction channels of endoscopes and the internal chambers of AERs during 1996–2001 and reported 8.7% of samples collected during 1996–1998 had bacterial growth, with 54% being Pseudomonas species. After a system of hot water flushing of the piping (60oC for 60 minutes daily) was introduced, the frequency of positive cultures fell to approximately 2% with only rare isolation of >10 CFU/mL 161. In addition to the endoscope reprocessing steps, a protocol should be developed that ensures the user knows whether an endoscope has been appropriately cleaned and disinfected (e.g., using a room or cabinet for processed endoscopes only) or has not been reprocessed. When users leave endoscopes on movable carts, confusion can result about whether the endoscope has been processed.

As part of a quality assurance program, healthcare facility personnel can consider random bacterial surveillance cultures of processed endoscopes to ensure high-level disinfection or sterilization7, 162-164 . Reprocessed endoscopes should be free of microbial pathogens except for small numbers of relatively avirulent microbes that represent exogenous environmental contamination (e.g., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Bacillus species, diphtheroids). Although recommendations exist for the final rinse water used during endoscope Last update: June 2024 17 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) reprocessing to be microbiologically cultured at least monthly 165, a microbiologic standard has not been set, and the value of routine endoscope cultures has not been shown 166. In addition, neither the routine culture of reprocessed endoscopes nor the final rinse water has been validated by correlating viable counts on an endoscope to infection after an endoscopic procedure. If reprocessed endoscopes were cultured, sampling the endoscope would assess water quality and other important steps (e.g., disinfectant effectiveness, exposure time, cleaning) in the reprocessing procedure. A number of methods for sampling endoscopes and water have been described 23, 157, 161, 163, 167, 168. Novel approaches (e.g., detection of adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) to evaluate the effectiveness of endoscope cleaning 169, 170 or endoscope reprocessing 171 also have been evaluated, but no method has been established as a standard for assessing the outcome of endoscope reprocessing. The carrying case used to transport clean and reprocessed endoscopes outside the health-care environment should not be used to store an endoscope or to transport the instrument within the health- care facility. A contaminated endoscope should never be placed in the carrying case because the case can also become contaminated. When the endoscope is removed from the case, properly reprocessed, and put back in the case, the case could recontaminate the endoscope. A contaminated carrying case should be discarded (Olympus America, June 2002, written communication). Infection-control professionals should ensure that institutional policies are consistent with national guidelines and conduct infection-control rounds periodically (e.g., at least annually) in areas where endoscopes are reprocessed to ensure policy compliance. Breaches in policy should be documented and corrective action instituted. In incidents in which endoscopes were not exposed to a high-level disinfection process, patients exposed to potentially contaminated endoscopes have been assessed for possible acquisition of HIV, HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

The possible transmission of bloodborne and other infectious agents highlights the importance of rigorous infection control172, 173. Laparoscopes and Arthroscopes Although high-level disinfection appears to be the minimum standard for processing laparoscopes and arthroscopes between patients 28, 86, 174, 175, this practice continues to be debated 89, 90, 176. However, neither side in the high-level disinfection versus sterilization debate has sufficient data on which to base its conclusions. Proponents of high-level disinfection refer to membership surveys 29 or institutional experiences 87 involving more than 117,000 and 10,000 laparoscopic procedures, respectively, that cite a low risk for infection (<0.3%) when high-level disinfection is used for gynecologic laparoscopic equipment. Only one infection in the membership survey was linked to spores. In addition, growth of common skin microorganisms (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids) has been documented from the umbilical area even after skin preparation with povidone-iodine and ethyl alcohol. Similar organisms were recovered in some instances from the pelvic serosal surfaces or from the laparoscopic telescopes, suggesting that the microorganisms probably were carried from the skin into the peritoneal cavity 177, 178. Proponents of sterilization focus on the possibility of transmitting infection by spore-forming organisms. Researchers have proposed several reasons why sterility was not necessary for all laparoscopic equipment: only a limited number of organisms (usually ≤10) are introduced into the peritoneal cavity during laparoscopy; minimal damage is done to inner abdominal structures with little devitalized tissue; the peritoneal cavity tolerates small numbers of spore-forming bacteria; equipment is simple to clean and disinfect; surgical sterility is relative; the natural bioburden on rigid lumened devices is low179; and no evidence exists that high-level disinfection instead of sterilization increases the risk for infection 87, 89, 90. With the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, concern about high-level disinfection is justifiable because the degree of tissue damage and bacterial contamination is greater than with laparoscopic procedures in gynecology. Failure to completely dissemble, clean, and high-level disinfect laparoscope parts has led to infections in patients180. Data from one study suggested that disassembly, cleaning, and proper reassembly of laparoscopic equipment used in gynecologic procedures before steam sterilization presents no risk for infection181.

A retrospective study of 12,505 arthroscopic procedures found an infection rate of 0.04% (five infections) when arthroscopes were soaked in 2% glutaraldehyde for 15– 20 minutes. Four infections were caused by S. aureus; the fifth was an anaerobic streptococcal infection 88.Because these organisms are very susceptible to high-level disinfectants, such as 2% glutaraldehyde, the infections most likely originated from the patient’s skin. Two cases of Clostridium perfringens arthritis have been reported when the arthroscope was disinfected with glutaraldehyde for an exposure time that is not effective against spores 182, 183. Although only limited data are available, the evidence does not demonstrate that high-level disinfection of arthroscopes and laparoscopes poses an infection risk to the patient. For example, a prospective study that compared the reprocessing of arthroscopes and laparoscopes (per 1,000 procedures) with EtO sterilization to high-level disinfection with glutaraldehyde found no statistically significant difference in infection risk between the two methods (i.e., EtO, 7.5/1,000 procedures; glutaraldehyde, 2.5/1,000 procedures)89. Although the debate for high-level disinfection versus sterilization of laparoscopes and arthroscopes will go unsettled until well-designed, randomized clinical trials are published, this guideline should be followed 1, 17. That is, laparoscopes, arthroscopes, and other scopes that enter normally sterile tissue should be sterilized before each use; if this is not feasible, they should receive at least high-level disinfection. Tonometers, Cervical Diaphragm Fitting Rings, Cryosurgical Instruments, and Endocavitary Probes Disinfection strategies vary widely for other semicritical items (e.g., applanation tonometers, rectal/vaginal probes, cryosurgical instruments, and diaphragm fitting rings). FDA requests that device manufacturers include at least one validated cleaning and disinfection/sterilization protocol in the labeling for their devices. As with all medications and devices, users should be familiar with the label instructions. One study revealed that no uniform technique was in use for disinfection of applanation tonometers, with disinfectant contact times varying from <15 sec to 20 minutes 28. In view of the potential for transmission of viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus [HSV], adenovirus 8, or HIV) 184 by tonometer tips, CDC recommended that the tonometer tips be wiped clean and disinfected for 5-10 minutes with either 3% hydrogen peroxide, 5000 ppm chlorine, 70% ethyl alcohol, or 70% isopropyl alcohol 95. However, more recent data suggest that 3% hydrogen peroxide and 70% isopropyl alcohol are not effective against adenovirus capable of causing epidemic keratoconjunctivitis and similar viruses and should not be used for disinfecting applanation tonometers 49, 185, 186.

Structural damage to Schiotz tonometers has been observed with a 1:10 sodium hypochlorite (5,000 ppm chlorine) and 3% hydrogen peroxide187. After disinfection, the tonometer should be thoroughly rinsed in tapwater and air dried before use. Although these disinfectants and exposure times should kill pathogens that can infect the eyes, no studies directly support this 188, 189. The guidelines of the American Academy of Ophthalmology for preventing infections in ophthalmology focus on only one potential pathogen: HIV. 190 Because a short and simple decontamination procedure is desirable in the clinical setting, swabbing the tonometer tip with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe sometimes is practiced. 189 Preliminary reports suggest that wiping the tonometer tip with an alcohol swab and then allowing the alcohol to evaporate might be effective in eliminating HSV, HIV, and adenovirus189, 191, 192. However, because these studies involved only a few replicates and were conducted in a controlled laboratory setting, further studies are needed before this technique can be recommended. In addition, two reports have found that disinfection of pneumotonometer tips between uses with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe contributed to outbreaks of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis caused Last update: June 2024 19 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) by adenovirus type 8193, 194. Limited studies have evaluated disinfection techniques for other items that contact mucous membranes, such as diaphragm fitting rings, cryosurgical probes, transesophageal echocardiography probes 195, flexible cystoscopes 196 or vaginal/rectal probes used in sonographic scanning. Lettau, Bond, and McDougal of CDC supported the recommendation of a diaphragm fitting ring manufacturer that involved using a soap-and-water wash followed by a 15-minute immersion in 70% alcohol96. This disinfection method should be adequate to inactivate HIV, HBV, and HSV even though alcohols are not classified as high-level disinfectants because their activity against picornaviruses is somewhat limited72. No data are available regarding inactivation of human papillomavirus (HPV) by alcohol or other disinfectants because in vitro replication of complete virions has not been achieved. Thus, even though alcohol for 15 minutes should kill pathogens of relevance in gynecology, no clinical studies directly support this practice. Vaginal probes are used in sonographic scanning. A vaginal probe and all endocavitary probes without a probe cover are semicritical devices because they have direct contact with mucous membranes (e.g., vagina, rectum, pharynx).

The relevance of this recommendation is reinforced with the findings that sterile transvaginal ultrasound probe covers have a very high rate of perforations even before use (0%, 25%, and 65% perforations from three suppliers). 199 One study found, after oocyte retrieval use, a very high rate of perforations in used endovaginal probe covers from two suppliers (75% and 81%) 199, other studies demonstrated a lower rate of perforations after use of condoms (2.0% and 0.9%) 197 200. Condoms have been found superior to commercially available probe covers for covering the ultrasound probe (1.7% for condoms versus 8.3% leakage for probe covers)201. These studies underscore the need for routine probe disinfection between examinations. Although most ultrasound manufacturers recommend use of 2% glutaraldehyde for high- level disinfection of contaminated transvaginal transducers, the this agent has been questioned 202 because it might shorten the life of the transducer and might have toxic effects on the gametes and embryos 203. An alternative procedure for disinfecting the vaginal transducer involves the mechanical removal of the gel from the transducer, cleaning the transducer in soap and water, wiping the transducer with 70% alcohol or soaking it for 2 minutes in 500 ppm chlorine, and rinsing with tap water and air drying204. The effectiveness of this and other methods 200 has not been validated in either rigorous laboratory experiments or in clinical use. High-level disinfection with a product (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) that is not toxic to staff, patients, probes, and retrieved cells should be used until the effectiveness of alternative procedures against microbes of importance at the cavitary site is demonstrated by well- designed experimental scientific studies. Other probes such as rectal, cryosurgical, and transesophageal probes or devices also should be high-level disinfected between patients. Ultrasound probes used during surgical procedures also can contact sterile body sites. These probes can be covered with a sterile sheath to reduce the level of contamination on the probe and reduce the risk for infection. However, because the sheath does not completely protect the probe, the probes should be sterilized between each patient use as with other critical items.

Health-care facilities that use nonimmersible probes should replace them as soon as possible with fully immersible probes. As with other high-level disinfection procedures, proper cleaning of probes is necessary to ensure the success of the subsequent disinfection 205. One study demonstrated that vegetative bacteria Last update: June 2024 20 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) inoculated on vaginal ultrasound probes decreased when the probes were cleaned with a towel 206. No information is available about either the level of contamination of such probes by potential viral pathogens such as HBV and HPV or their removal by cleaning (such as with a towel). Because these pathogens might be present in vaginal and rectal secretions and contaminate probes during use, high- level disinfection of the probes after such use is recommended. Dental Instruments Scientific articles and increased publicity about the potential for transmitting infectious agents in dentistry have focused attention on dental instruments as possible agents for pathogen transmission207, 208. The American Dental Association recommends that surgical and other instruments that normally penetrate soft tissue or bone (e.g., extraction forceps, scalpel blades, bone chisels, periodontal scalers, and surgical burs) be classified as critical devices that should be sterilized after each use or discarded. Instruments not intended to penetrate oral soft tissues or bone (e.g., amalgam condensers, and air/water syringes) but that could contact oral tissues are classified as semicritical, but sterilization after each use is recommended if the instruments are heat-tolerant 43, 209. If a semicritical item is heat–sensitive, it should, at a minimum, be processed with high-level disinfection 43, 210. Handpieces can be contaminated internally with patient material and should be heat sterilized after each patient. Handpieces that cannot be heat sterilized should not be used. 211 Methods of sterilization that can be used for critical or semicritical dental instruments and materials that are heat-stable include steam under pressure (autoclave), chemical (formaldehyde) vapor, and dry heat (e.g., 320oF for 2 hours). Dental professionals most commonly use the steam sterilizer 212. All three sterilization procedures can damage some dental instruments, including steam-sterilized hand pieces 213. Heat-tolerant alternatives are available for most clinical dental applications and are preferred43.

CDC has divided noncritical surfaces in dental offices into clinical contact and housekeeping surfaces43. Clinical contact surfaces are surfaces that might be touched frequently with gloved hands during patient care or that might become contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious material and subsequently contact instruments, hands, gloves, or devices (e.g., light handles, switches, dental X- ray equipment, chair-side computers). Barrier protective coverings (e.g., clear plastic wraps) can be used for these surfaces, particularly those that are difficult to clean (e.g., light handles, chair switches). The coverings should be changed when visibly soiled or damaged and routinely (e.g., between patients). Protected surfaces should be disinfected at the end of each day or if contamination is evident. If not barrier-protected, these surfaces should be disinfected between patients with an intermediate-disinfectant (i.e., EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with tuberculocidal claim) or low-level disinfectant (i.e., EPA- registered hospital disinfectant with an HBV and HIV label claim) 43, 214, 215. Most housekeeping surfaces need to be cleaned only with a detergent and water or an EPA- registered hospital disinfectant, depending of the nature of the surface and the type and degree of contamination. When housekeeping surfaces are visibly contaminated by blood or body substances, however, prompt removal and surface disinfection is a sound infection control practice and required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 43, 214. Several studies have demonstrated variability among dental practices while trying to meet these recommendations216, 217. For example, 68% of respondents believed they were sterilizing their instruments but did not use appropriate chemical sterilants or exposure times and 49% of respondents did not challenge autoclaves with biological indicators216. Other investigators using biologic indicators have found a high proportion (15%–65%) of positive spore tests after assessing the efficacy of sterilizers used in dental offices. In one study of Minnesota dental offices, operator error, rather than mechanical malfunction218, caused 87% of sterilization failures. Common factors in the improper use of sterilizers include chamber overload, low temperature setting, inadequate exposure time, failure to preheat the sterilizer, and interruption of the cycle.

In addition, mycobacterial infection is unlikely to be clinically apparent in many patients. In most instances, hospitals that altered their disinfection procedure used EtO sterilization on the endoscopic instruments because they believed this practice reduced the risk for infection 28, 239. EtO is not routinely used for endoscope sterilization because of the lengthy processing time. Endoscopes and other semicritical devices should be managed the same way regardless of whether the patient is known to be infected with HBV, HCV, HIV or M. tuberculosis. An evaluation of a manual disinfection procedure to eliminate HCV from experimentally contaminated endoscopes provided some evidence that cleaning and 2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes should prevent transmission 236. A study that used experimentally contaminated hysteroscopes detected HCV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in one (3%) of 34 samples after cleaning with a detergent, but no samples were positive after treatment with a 2% glutaraldehyde solution for 20 minutes 120. Another study demonstrated complete elimination of HCV (as detected by PCR) from endoscopes used on chronically infected patients after cleaning and disinfection for 3–5 minutes in glutaraldehyde 118. Similarly, PCR was used to demonstrate complete elimination of HCV after standard disinfection of experimentally contaminated endoscopes 236 and endoscopes used on HCV-antibody– positive patients had no detectable HCV RNA after high-level disinfection 243. The inhibitory activity of a phenolic and a chlorine compound on HCV showed that the phenolic inhibited the binding and replication of HCV, but the chlorine was ineffective, probably because of its low concentration and its neutralization in the presence of organic matter 244. Disinfection in the Hemodialysis Unit Hemodialysis systems include hemodialysis machines, water supply, water-treatment systems, and distribution systems. During hemodialysis, patients have acquired bloodborne viruses and pathogenic bacteria 245-247. Cleaning and disinfection are important components of infection control in a hemodialysis center. EPA and FDA regulate disinfectants used to reprocess hemodialyzers, hemodialysis machines, and water-treatment systems.

Noncritical surfaces (e.g., dialysis bed or chair, countertops, external surfaces of dialysis machines, and equipment [scissors, hemostats, clamps, blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes]) should be disinfected with an EPA-registered disinfectant unless the item is visibly contaminated with blood; in that case a tuberculocidal agent (or a disinfectant with specific label claims for HBV and HIV) or a 1:100 dilution of a hypochlorite solution (500–600 ppm free chlorine) should be used 246, 248. This procedure accomplishes two goals: it removes soil on a regular basis and maintains an environment that is consistent with good patient care. Hemodialyzers are disinfected with peracetic acid, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, heat pasteurization with citric acid, and chlorine-containing compounds 249. Hemodialysis systems usually are disinfected by chlorine-based disinfectants (e.g., sodium hypochlorite), aqueous Last update: June 2024 22 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) formaldehyde, heat pasteurization, ozone, or peracetic acid 250, 251. All products must be used according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. Some dialysis systems use hot-water disinfection to control microbial contamination. At its high point, 82% of U.S. chronic hemodialysis centers were reprocessing (i.e., reusing) dialyzers for the same patient using high-level disinfection 249. However, one of the large dialysis organizations has decided to phase out reuse and, by 2002 the percentage of dialysis facilities reprocessing hemodialyzers had decreased to 63% 252. The two commonly used disinfectants to reprocess dialyzers were peracetic acid and formaldehyde; 72% used peracetic acid and 20% used formaldehyde to disinfect hemodialyzers. Another 4% of the facilities used either glutaraldehyde or heat pasteurization in combination with citric acid 252. Infection-control recommendations, including disinfection and sterilization and the use of dedicated machines for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)- positive patients, in the hemodialysis setting were detailed in two reviews 245, 246. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation(AAMI) has published recommendations for the reuse of hemodialyzers253. Inactivation of Clostridium difficile The source of health-care–associated acquisition of Clostridium difficile in nonepidemic settings has not been determined. The environment and carriage on the hands of health-care personnel have been considered possible sources of infection 66, 254. Carpeted rooms occupied by a patient with C. difficile were more heavily contaminated with C. difficile than were noncarpeted rooms 255. Because C. difficile spore-production can increase when exposed to nonchlorine-based cleaning agents and the spores are more resistant than vegetative cells to commonly used surface disinfectants256, some investigators have recommended use of dilute solutions of hypochlorite (1,600 ppm available chlorine) for routine environmental disinfection of rooms of patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea or colitis 257, to reduce the incidence of C. difficile diarrhea 258, or in units with high C. difficile rates. 259 Stool samples of", "page_start": 22, "page_end": 23, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

C. difficile-associated diarrhea rates were shown to have decreased markedly in a bone-marrow transplant unit (from 8.6 to 3.3 cases per 1,000 patient-days) during a period of bleach disinfection (1:10 dilution) of environmental surfaces compared with cleaning with a quaternary ammonium compound. C.difficile Update [May 2019] EPA-registered products specific for inactivating C. difficile spores, should be used in units with high C. difficile rates. Thus, combined use of appropriate hand hygiene, barrier precautions, and meticulous environmental cleaning, and use of an EPA-registered disinfectant that is appropriate for the level of risk, should effectively prevent spread of the organism. [LIST K: EPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective against Clostridium difficile Spores] Acidified bleach and regular bleach (5000 ppm chlorine) can inactivate 106 C. difficile spores in ≤10 minutes 262. However, studies have shown that asymptomatic patients constitute an important reservoir within the health-care facility and that person-to-person transmission is the principal means of transmission between patients. Thus, combined use of hand washing, barrier precautions, and meticulous environmental cleaning with an EPA-registered disinfectant (e.g., germicidal detergent) should effectively prevent spread of the organism 263. Contaminated medical devices, such as colonoscopes and thermometers,can be vehicles for transmission of C. difficile spores 264. For this reason, investigators have studied commonly used disinfectants and exposure times to assess whether current practices can place patients at risk. Data demonstrate that 2% glutaraldehyde 79, 265-267 and peracetic acid 267, 268 reliably kill C. difficile spores using exposure times of 5–20 minutes. ortho-Phthalaldehyde and ≥0.2% peracetic acid (WA Rutala, personal communication, April 2006) also can inactivate ≥104 C. difficile spores in 10–12 minutes at 20oC 268.Sodium dichloroisocyanurate at a concentration of 1000 ppm available chlorine achieved lower log10 reduction factors against C. difficile spores at 10 min, ranging from 0.7 to 1.5, than 0.26% peracetic acid Last update: June 2024 23 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) with log10 reduction factors ranging from 2.7 to 6.0268.

One component of this requirement is that all equipment and environmental and working surfaces be cleaned and decontaminated with an appropriate disinfectant after contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. Even though the OSHA standard does not specify the type of disinfectant or procedure, the OSHA original compliance document 269 suggested that a germicide must be tuberculocidal to kill the HBV. To follow the OSHA compliance document a tuberculocidal disinfectant (e.g., phenolic, and chlorine) would be needed to clean a blood spill. However, in February 1997, OSHA amended its policy and stated that EPA-registered disinfectants labeled as effective against HIV and HBV would be considered as appropriate disinfectants “. . . provided such surfaces have not become contaminated with agent(s) or volumes of or concentrations of agent(s) for which higher level disinfection is recommended.” When bloodborne pathogens other than HBV or HIV are of concern, OSHA continues to require use of EPA-registered tuberculocidal disinfectants or hypochlorite solution (diluted 1:10 or 1:100 with water) 215, 228. Studies demonstrate that, in the presence of large blood spills, a 1:10 final dilution of EPA-registered hypochlorite solution initially should be used to inactivate bloodborne viruses 63, 235 to minimize risk for infection to health-care personnel from percutaneous injury during cleanup. Emerging Pathogens (Cryptosporidium, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Rotavirus, Human Papilloma Virus, Norovirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SARS] Coronavirus) Emerging pathogens are of growing concern to the general public and infection-control professionals. Relevant pathogens include Cryptosporidium parvum, Helicobacter pylori, E. coli O157:H7, HIV, HCV, rotavirus, norovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis, and nontuberculous mycobacteria (e.g., M. chelonae). The susceptibility of each of these pathogens to chemical disinfectants and sterilants has been studied. With the exceptions discussed below, all of these emerging pathogens are susceptible to currently available chemical disinfectants and sterilants 270. Cryptosporidium is resistant to chlorine at concentrations used in potable water. C. parvum is not completely inactivated by most disinfectants used in healthcare including ethyl alcohol 271, glutaraldehyde 271, 272, 5.25% hypochlorite 271, peracetic acid 271, ortho-phthalaldehyde 271, phenol 271, 272, povidone-iodine 271, 272, and quaternary ammonium compounds271. The only chemical disinfectants and sterilants able to inactivate greater than 3 log10 of C. parvum were 6% and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide 271. Sterilization methods will fully inactivate C. parvum, including steam 271, EtO 271, 273, and hydrogen peroxide gas plasma271. Although most disinfectants are ineffective against C. parvum, current cleaning and disinfection practices appear satisfactory to prevent healthcare-associated transmission. For example, endoscopes are unlikely to be an important vehicle for transmitting C. parvum because the results of bacterial studies indicate mechanical cleaning will remove approximately 104 organisms, and drying results in rapid loss of C. parvum viability (e.g., 30 minutes, 2.9 log10 decrease; and 60", "page_start": 24, "page_end": 24, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

Chlorine at ~1 ppm has been found capable of eliminating approximately 4 log10 of E. coli O157:H7 within 1 minute in a suspension test64. Electrolyzed oxidizing water at 23°C was effective in 10 minutes in producing a 5-log10 decrease in E. coli O157:H7 inoculated onto kitchen cutting boards274. The following disinfectants eliminated >5 log10 of E. coli O157:H7 within 30 seconds: a quaternary ammonium compound, a phenolic, a hypochlorite (1:10 dilution of 5.25% bleach), and ethanol53. Disinfectants including chlorine compounds can reduce E. coli O157:H7 experimentally inoculated onto alfalfa seeds or sprouts 275, 276 or beef carcass surfaces277. Last update: June 2024 24 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Data are limited on the susceptibility of H. pylori to disinfectants. Using a suspension test, one study assessed the effectiveness of a variety of disinfectants against nine strains of H. pylori 60. Ethanol (80%) and glutaraldehyde (0.5%) killed all strains within 15 seconds; chlorhexidine gluconate (0.05%, 1.0%), benzalkonium chloride (0.025%, 0.1%), alkyldiaminoethylglycine hydrochloride (0.1%), povidone-iodine (0.1%), and sodium hypochlorite (150 ppm) killed all strains within 30 seconds. Both ethanol (80%) and glutaraldehyde (0.5%) retained similar bactericidal activity in the presence of organic matter; the other disinfectants showed reduced bactericidal activity. In particular, the bactericidal activity of povidone- iodine (0.1%) and sodium hypochlorite (150 ppm) markedly decreased in the presence of dried yeast solution with killing times increased to 5 - 10 minutes and 5 - 30 minutes, respectively. Immersing biopsy forceps in formalin before obtaining a specimen does not affect the ability to culture H. pylori from the biopsy specimen 278. The following methods are ineffective for eliminating H. pylori from endoscopes: cleaning with soap and water 119, 279, immersion in 70% ethanol for 3 minutes280, instillation of 70% ethanol126, instillation of 30 ml of 83% methanol279, and instillation of 0.2% Hyamine solution281. The differing results with regard to the efficacy of ethyl alcohol against Helicobacter are unexplained. Cleaning followed by use of 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde (or automated peracetic acid) has been demonstrated by culture to be effective in eliminating H. pylori 119, 279, 282. Epidemiologic investigations of patients who had undergone endoscopy with endoscopes mechanically washed and disinfected with 2.0%–2.3% glutaraldehyde have revealed no evidence of person-to- person transmission of H. pylori 126, 283. Disinfection of experimentally contaminated endoscopes using 2% glutaraldehyde (10-minute, 20-minute, 45-minute exposure times) or the peracetic acid system (with and without active peracetic acid) has been demonstrated to be effective in eliminating H. pylori 119.

H. pylori DNA has been detected by PCR in fluid flushed from endoscope channels after cleaning and disinfection with 2% glutaraldehyde 284. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In vitro experiments have demonstrated a >3.5-log10 reduction in H. pylori after exposure to 0.5 mg/L of free chlorine for 80 seconds285. An outbreak of healthcare-associated rotavirus gastroenteritis on a pediatric unit has been reported 286.Person to person through the hands of health-care workers was proposed as the mechanism of transmission. Prolonged survival of rotavirus on environmental surfaces (90 minutes to >10 days at room temperature) and hands (>4 hours) has been demonstrated. Rotavirus suspended in feces can survive longer 287, 288. Vectors have included hands, fomites, air, water, and food 288, 289. Products with demonstrated efficacy (>3 log10 reduction in virus) against rotavirus within 1 minute include: 95% ethanol, 70% isopropanol, some phenolics, 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.35% peracetic acid, and some quaternary ammonium compounds 59, 290-293. In a human challenge study, a disinfectant spray (0.1% ortho- phenylphenol and 79% ethanol), sodium hypochlorite (800 ppm free chlorine), and a phenol-based product (14.7% phenol diluted 1:256 in tapwater) when sprayed onto contaminated stainless steel disks, were effective in interrupting transfer of a human rotavirus from stainless steel disk to fingerpads of volunteers after an exposure time of 3- 10 minutes. A quaternary ammonium product (7.05% quaternary ammonium compound diluted 1:128 in tapwater) and tapwater allowed transfer of virus 52. No data exist on the inactivation of HPV by alcohol or other disinfectants because in vitro replication of complete virions has not been achieved. Similarly, little is known about inactivation of noroviruses (members of the family Caliciviridae and important causes of gastroenteritis in humans) because they cannot be grown in tissue culture. Improper disinfection of environmental surfaces contaminated by feces or vomitus of infected patients is believed to play a role in the spread of noroviruses in some settings 294-296. Prolonged survival of a norovirus surrogate (i.e., feline calicivirus virus [FCV], a closely related cultivable virus) has been demonstrated (e.g., at room temperature, FCV in a dried state survived for 21–18 days) 297. Inactivation studies with FCV have shown the effectiveness of chlorine, glutaraldehyde, and iodine-based products whereas the quaternary ammonium compound, detergent, and ethanol failed to inactivate the virus completely. 297 An evaluation of the effectiveness of several disinfectants against the feline calicivirus found that bleach diluted to 1000 ppm of available chlorine reduced infectivity of FCV by 4.5 logs in 1 minute.

CDC announced that a previously unrecognized human virus from the coronavirus family is the leading hypothesis for the cause of a described syndrome of SARS 301. Two coronaviruses that are known to infect humans cause one third of common colds and can cause gastroenteritis. The virucidal efficacy of chemical germicides against coronavirus has been investigated. A study of disinfectants against coronavirus 229E found several that were effective after a 1-minute contact time; these included sodium hypochlorite (at a free chlorine concentration of 1,000 ppm and 5,000 ppm), 70% ethyl alcohol, and povidone-iodine (1% iodine) 186. In another study, 70% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, 0.05% benzalkonium chloride, 50 ppm iodine in iodophor, 0.23% sodium chlorite, 1% cresol soap and 0.7% formaldehyde inactivated >3 logs of two animal coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus, canine coronavirus) after a 10-minute exposure time 302. The activity of povidone-iodine has been demonstrated against human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 303. A study also showed complete inactivation of the SARS coronavirus by 70% ethanol and povidone-iodine with an exposure times of 1 minute and 2.5% glutaraldehyde with an exposure time of 5 minute 304. Because the SARS coronavirus is stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least 1–2 days [The current version of this document may differ from original: First data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus compiled by members of WHO laboratory network (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/survival_2003_05_04/en/)], surfaces might be a possible source of contamination and lead to infection with the SARS coronavirus and should be disinfected.

Free-living amoeba can be pathogenic and can harbor agents of pneumonia such as Legionella pneumophila. Limited studies have shown that 2% glutaraldehyde and peracetic acid do not completely inactivate Acanthamoeba polyphaga in a 20-minute exposure time for high-level disinfection. If amoeba are found to contaminate instruments and facilitate infection, longer immersion times or other disinfectants may need to be considered 305. Inactivation of Bioterrorist Agents Publications have highlighted concerns about the potential for biological terrorism306, 307. CDC has categorized several agents as “high priority” because they can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, cause high mortality, and are likely to cause public panic and social disruption 308. These agents include Bacillus anthracis (the cause of anthrax), Yersinia pestis (plague), variola major (smallpox), Clostridium botulinum toxin (botulism), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), filoviruses (Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Marburg hemorrhagic fever); and arenaviruses (Lassa [Lassa fever], Junin [Argentine hemorrhagic fever]), and related viruses308. A few comments can be made regarding the role of sterilization and disinfection of potential agents of bioterrorism309. First, the susceptibility of these agents to germicides in vitro is similar to that of other related pathogens. For example, variola is similar to vaccinia 72, 310, 311 and B. anthracis is similar to B. atrophaeus (formerly B. subtilis)312, 313. B. subtilis spores, for instance, proved as resistant as, if not more resistant than, B. anthracis spores (>6 log10 reduction of B. anthracis spores in 5 minutes with acidified bleach [5,250 ppm chlorine])313. Thus, one can extrapolate from the larger database available on the susceptibility of genetically similar organisms314. Second, many of the potential bioterrorist agents are Last update: June 2024 26 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) stable enough in the environment that contaminated environmental surfaces or fomites could lead to transmission of agents such as B. anthracis, F. tularensis, variola major, C. botulinum toxin, and C. burnetti 315. Third, data suggest that current disinfection and sterilization practices are appropriate for managing patient-care equipment and environmental surfaces when potentially contaminated patients are evaluated and/or admitted in a health-care facility after exposure to a bioterrorist agent. For example, sodium hypochlorite can be used for surface disinfection (see [This link is no longer active: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/chemicals/bleachfactsheet.htm.]). In instances where the health-care facility is the site of a bioterrorist attack, environmental decontamination might require special decontamination procedures (e.g., chlorine dioxide gas for B. anthracis spores).

Of only theoretical concern is the possibility that a bioterrorist agent could be engineered to be less susceptible to disinfection and sterilization processes 309. Toxicological, Environmental and Occupational Concerns Health hazards associated with the use of germicides in healthcare vary from mucous membrane irritation to death, with the latter involving accidental injection by mentally disturbed patients316. Although their degrees of toxicity vary 317-320, all disinfectants should be used with the proper safety precautions 321 and only for the intended purpose. Key factors associated with assessing the health risk of a chemical exposure include the duration, intensity (i.e., how much chemical is involved), and route (e.g., skin, mucous membranes, and inhalation) of exposure. Toxicity can be acute or chronic. Acute toxicity usually results from an accidental spill of a chemical substance. Exposure is sudden and often produces an emergency situation. Chronic toxicity results from repeated exposure to low levels of the chemical over a prolonged period. Employers are responsible for informing workers about the chemical hazards in the workplace and implementing control measures. The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200, 1915.99, 1917.28, 1918.90, 1926.59, and 1928.21) requires manufacturers and importers of hazardous chemicals to develop Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each chemical or mixture of chemicals. Employers must have these data sheets readily available to employees who work with the products to which they could be exposed. Exposure limits have been published for many chemicals used in health care to help provide a safe environment and, as relevant, are discussed in each section of this guideline. Only the exposure limits published by OSHA carry the legal force of regulations. OSHA publishes a limit as a time-weighted average (TWA), that is, the average concentration for a normal 8-hour work day and a 40-hour work week to which nearly all workers can be repeatedly exposed to a chemical without adverse health effects. For example, the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for EtO is 1.0 ppm, 8 hour TWA. The CDC National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) develops recommended exposure limits (RELs). RELs are occupational exposure limits recommended by NIOSH as being protective of worker health and safety over a working lifetime. This limit is frequently expressed as a 40-hour TWA exposure for up to 10 hours per day during a 40-hour work week. These exposure limits are designed for inhalation exposures.

RELs are occupational exposure limits recommended by NIOSH as being protective of worker health and safety over a working lifetime. This limit is frequently expressed as a 40-hour TWA exposure for up to 10 hours per day during a 40-hour work week. These exposure limits are designed for inhalation exposures. Irritant and allergic effects can occur below the exposure limits, and skin contact can result in dermal effects or systemic absorption without inhalation. The American Conference on Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIN) also provides guidelines on exposure limits 322. Information about workplace exposures and methods to reduce them (e.g., work practices, engineering controls, PPE) is available on the OSHA (https://www.osha.gov/) and NIOSH (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/) websites. Some states have excluded or limited concentrations of certain chemical germicides (e.g., glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and some phenols) from disposal through the sewer system. These Last update: June 2024 27 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) rules are intended to minimize environmental harm. If health-care facilities exceed the maximum allowable concentration of a chemical (e.g., ≥5.0 mg/L), they have three options. First, they can switch to alternative products; for example, they can change from glutaraldehyde to another disinfectant for high-level disinfection or from phenolics to quaternary ammonium compounds for low-level disinfection. Second, the health-care facility can collect the disinfectant and dispose of it as a hazardous chemical. Third, the facility can use a commercially available small-scale treatment method (e.g., neutralize glutaraldehyde with glycine). Safe disposal of regulated chemicals is important throughout the medical community. For disposal of large volumes of spent solutions, users might decide to neutralize the microbicidal activity before disposal (e.g., glutaraldehyde). Solutions can be neutralized by reaction with chemicals such as sodium bisulfite 323, 324 or glycine 325. European authors have suggested that instruments and ventilation therapy equipment should be disinfected by heat rather than by chemicals. The concerns for chemical disinfection include toxic side effects for the patient caused by chemical residues on the instrument or object, occupational exposure to toxic chemicals, and recontamination by rinsing the disinfectant with microbially contaminated tap water 326. Disinfection in Ambulatory Care, Home Care, and the Home With the advent of managed healthcare, increasing numbers of patients are now being cared for in ambulatory-care and home settings. Many patients in these settings might have communicable diseases, immunocompromising conditions, or invasive devices. Therefore, adequate disinfection in these settings is necessary to provide a safe patient environment. Because the ambulatory-care setting (i.e., outpatient facility) provides the same risk for infection as the hospital, the Spaulding classification scheme described in this guideline should be followed (Table 1).17 The home environment should be much safer than hospitals or ambulatory care. Epidemics should not be a problem, and cross-infection should be rare.

Among the products recommended for home disinfection of reusable objects are bleach, alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide. APIC recommends that reusable objects (e.g., tracheostomy tubes) that touch mucous membranes be disinfected by immersion in 70% isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes or in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes. Additionally, a 1:50 dilution of 5.25%–6.15% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) for 5 minutes should be effective 327-329. Noncritical items (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, crutches) can be cleaned with a detergent. Blood spills should be handled according to OSHA regulations as previously described (see section on OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard). In general, sterilization of critical items is not practical in homes but theoretically could be accomplished by chemical sterilants or boiling. Single-use disposable items can be used or reusable items sterilized in a hospital 330, 331. Some environmental groups advocate “environmentally safe” products as alternatives to commercial germicides in the home-care setting. These alternatives (e.g., ammonia, baking soda, vinegar, Borax, liquid detergent) are not registered with EPA and should not be used for disinfecting because they are ineffective against S. aureus. Borax, baking soda, and detergents also are ineffective against Salmonella Typhi and E.coli; however, undiluted vinegar and ammonia are effective against S. Typhi and E.coli 53, 332, 333.Common commercial disinfectants designed for home use also are effective against selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria 53. Public concerns have been raised that the use of antimicrobials in the home can promote development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria 334, 335. This issue is unresolved and needs to be considered Last update: June 2024 28 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) further through scientific and clinical investigations. The public health benefits of using disinfectants in the home are unknown. However, some facts are known: many sites in the home kitchen and bathroom are microbially contaminated 336, use of hypochlorites markedly reduces bacteria 337, and good standards of hygiene (e.g., food hygiene, hand hygiene) can help reduce infections in the home 338, 339. In addition, laboratory studies indicate that many commercially prepared household disinfectants are effective against common pathogens 53 and can interrupt surface-to-human transmission of pathogens 48.The “targeted hygiene concept”—which means identifying situations and areas (e.g., food- preparation surfaces and bathroom) where risk exists for transmission of pathogens—may be a reasonable way to identify when disinfection might be appropriate 340.

Susceptibility of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria to Disinfectants As with antibiotics, reduced susceptibility (or acquired “resistance”) of bacteria to disinfectants can arise by either chromosomal gene mutation or acquisition of genetic material in the form of plasmids or transposons 338, 341-343, 344 , 345, 346. When changes occur in bacterial susceptibility that renders an antibiotic ineffective against an infection previously treatable by that antibiotic, the bacteria are referred to as “resistant.” In contrast, reduced susceptibility to disinfectants does not correlate with failure of the disinfectant because concentrations used in disinfection still greatly exceed the cidal level. Thus, the word \"resistance\" when applied to these changes is incorrect, and the preferred term is “reduced susceptibility” or “increased tolerance”344, 347. No data are available that show that antibiotic-resistant bacteria are less sensitive to the liquid chemical germicides than antibiotic-sensitive bacteria at currently used germicide contact conditions and concentrations. MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) are important health-care–associated agents. Some antiseptics and disinfectants have been known for years to be, because of MICs, somewhat less inhibitory to S. aureus strains that contain a plasmid-carrying gene encoding resistance to the antibiotic gentamicin 344. For example, gentamicin resistance has been shown to also encode reduced susceptibility to propamidine, quaternary ammonium compounds, and ethidium bromide 348, and MRSA strains have been found to be less susceptible than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) strains to chlorhexidine, propamidine, and the quaternary ammonium compound cetrimide 349. In other studies, MRSA and MSSA strains have been equally sensitive to phenols and chlorhexidine, but MRSA strains were slightly more tolerant to quaternary ammonium compounds 350. Two gene families (qacCD [now referred to as smr] and qacAB) are involved in providing protection against agents that are components of disinfectant formulations such as quaternary ammonium compounds. Staphylococci have been proposed to evade destruction because the protein specified by the qacA determinant is a cytoplasmic-membrane–associated protein involved in an efflux system that actively reduces intracellular accumulation of toxicants, such as quaternary ammonium compounds, to intracellular targets. 351 Other studies demonstrated that plasmid-mediated formaldehyde tolerance is transferable from Serratia marcescens to E. coli 352 and plasmid-mediated quaternary ammonium tolerance is transferable from S. aureus to E. coli.353. Tolerance to mercury and silver also is plasmid borne. 341, 343-346 Because the concentrations of disinfectants used in practice are much higher than the MICs observed, even for the more tolerant strains, the clinical relevance of these observations is questionable. Several studies have found antibiotic-resistant hospital strains of common healthcare- associated pathogens (i.e., Enterococcus, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis) to be equally susceptible to disinfectants as antibiotic-sensitive strains 53, 354-356.

On the basis of these data, routine disinfection and housekeeping protocols do not need to be altered because of antibiotic resistance provided the disinfection method is effective 358, 359. A study that evaluated the efficacy of selected cleaning methods (e.g., QUAT-sprayed cloth, and QUAT-immersed cloth) for eliminating VRE found that currently used disinfection processes most likely are highly effective in eliminating VRE. However, surface disinfection must involve contact with all contaminated Last update: June 2024 29 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) surfaces 358. A new method using an invisible flurorescent marker to objectively evaluate the thoroughness of cleaning activities in patient rooms might lead to improvement in cleaning of all objects and surfaces but needs further evaluation. 360 Lastly, does the use of antiseptics or disinfectants facilitate the development of disinfectant-tolerant organisms? Evidence and reviews indicate enhanced tolerance to disinfectants can be developed in response to disinfectant exposure 334, 335, 346, 347, 361. However, the level of tolerance is not important in clinical terms because it is low and unlikely to compromise the effectiveness of disinfectants of which much higher concentrations are used 347, 362. The issue of whether low-level tolerance to germicides selects for antibiotic-resistant strains is unsettled but might depend on the mechanism by which tolerance is attained. For example, changes in the permeability barrier or efflux mechanisms might affect susceptibility to both antibiotics and germicides, but specific changes to a target site might not. Some researchers have suggested that use of disinfectants or antiseptics (e.g., triclosan) could facilitate development of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms 334, 335, 363. Although evidence in laboratory studies indicates low-level resistance to triclosan, the concentrations of triclosan in these studies were low (generally <1 μg/mL) and dissimilar from the higher levels used in antimicrobial products (2,000–20,000 μg/mL) 364, 365. Thus, researchers can create laboratory-derived mutants that demonstrate reduced susceptibility to antiseptics or disinfectants. In some experiments, such bacteria have demonstrated reduced susceptibility to certain antibiotics 335. There is no evidence that using antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature or that such mutants survive in nature366. ). In addition, the action of antibiotics and the action of disinfectants differ fundamentally. Antibiotics are selectively toxic and generally have a single target site in bacteria, thereby inhibiting a specific biosynthetic process. Germicides generally are considered nonspecific antimicrobials because of a multiplicity of toxic-effect mechanisms or target sites and are broader spectrum in the types of microorganisms against which they are effective 344, 347.

Germicides generally are considered nonspecific antimicrobials because of a multiplicity of toxic-effect mechanisms or target sites and are broader spectrum in the types of microorganisms against which they are effective 344, 347. The rotational use of disinfectants in some environments (e.g., pharmacy production units) has been recommended and practiced in an attempt to prevent development of resistant microbes 367, 368. There have been only rare case reports that appropriately used disinfectants have resulted in a clinical problem arising from the selection or development of nonsusceptible microorganisms 369. Surface Disinfection The effective use of disinfectants is part of a multibarrier strategy to prevent health-care–associated infections. Surfaces are considered noncritical items because they contact intact skin. Use of noncritical items or contact with noncritical surfaces carries little risk of causing an infection in patients or staff. Thus, the routine use of germicidal chemicals to disinfect hospital floors and other noncritical items is controversial 370-375. A 1991 study expanded the Spaulding scheme by dividing the noncritical environmental surfaces into housekeeping surfaces and medical equipment surfaces 376. The classes of disinfectants used on housekeeping and medical equipment surfaces can be similar. However, the frequency of decontaminating can vary (see Recommendations). Medical equipment surfaces (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, hemodialysis machines, and X-ray machines) can become contaminated with infectious agents and contribute to the spread of health-care–associated infections 248, 375. For this reason, noncritical medical equipment surfaces should be disinfected with an EPA-registered low- or intermediate-level disinfectant. Use of a disinfectant will provide antimicrobial activity that is likely to be achieved with minimal additional cost or work. Environmental surfaces (e.g., bedside table) also could potentially contribute to cross-transmission by contamination of health-care personnel from hand contact with contaminated surfaces, medical equipment, or patients 50, 375, 377. A paper reviews the epidemiologic and microbiologic data (Table 3) regarding the use of disinfectants on noncritical surfaces 378. Last update: June 2024 30 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Of the seven reasons to usie a disinfectant on noncritical surfaces, five are particularly noteworthy and support the use of a germicidal detergent. First, hospital floors become contaminated with microorganisms from settling airborne bacteria: by contact with shoes, wheels, and other objects; and occasionally by spills. The removal of microbes is a component in controling health-care–associated infections. In an investigation of the cleaning of hospital floors, the use of soap and water (80% reduction) was less effective in reducing the numbers of bacteria than was a phenolic disinfectant (94%– 99.9% reduction) 379. However, a few hours after floor disinfection, the bacterial count was nearly back to the pretreatment level.

Second, detergents become contaminated and result in seeding the patient’s environment with bacteria. Investigators have shown that mop water becomes increasingly dirty during cleaning and becomes contaminated if soap and water is used rather than a disinfectant. For example, in one study, bacterial contamination in soap and water without a disinfectant increased from 10 CFU/mL to 34,000 CFU/mL after cleaning a ward, whereas contamination in a disinfectant solution did not change (20 CFU/mL) 380. Contamination of surfaces close to the patient that are frequently touched by the patient or staff (e.g., bed rails) could result in patient exposures0 381. In a study, using of detergents on floors and patient room furniture, increased bacterial contamination of the patients’ environmental surfaces was found after cleaning (average increase = 103.6 CFU/24cm2) 382. In addition, a P. aeruginosa outbreak was reported in a hematology-oncology unit associated with contamination of the surface cleaning equipment when nongermicidal cleaning solutions instead of disinfectants were used to decontaminate the patients’ environment 383 and another study demonstrated the role of environmental cleaning in controlling an outbreak of Acinetobacter baumannii 384. Studies also have shown that, in situations where the cleaning procedure failed to eliminate contamination from the surface and the cloth is used to wipe another surface, the contamination is transferred to that surface and the hands of the person holding the cloth381, 385. Third, the CDC Isolation Guideline recommends that noncritical equipment contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions be cleaned and disinfected after use. The same guideline recommends that, in addition to cleaning, disinfection of the bedside equipment and environmental surfaces (e.g., bedrails, bedside tables, carts, commodes, door-knobs, and faucet handles) is indicated for certain pathogens, e.g., enterococci, which can survive in the inanimate environment for prolonged periods 386. Fourth, OSHA requires that surfaces contaminated with blood and other potentially infectious materials (e.g., amniotic, pleural fluid) be disinfected. Fifth, using a single product throughout the facility can simplify both training and appropriate practice. Reasons also exist for using a detergent alone on floors because noncritical surfaces contribute minimally to endemic health-care–associated infections 387, and no differences have been found in healthcare–associated infections rates when floors are cleaned with detergent rather than disinfectant 382, 388, 389. However, these studies have been small and of short duration and suffer from low statistical power because the outcome—healthcare–associated infections—is of low frequency. The low rate of infections makes the efficacy of an intervention statistically difficult to demonstrate. Because housekeeping surfaces are associated with the lowest risk for disease transmission, some researchers have suggested that either detergents or a disinfectant/detergent could be used 376.

Given this information; other information showing that environmental surfaces (e.g., bedside table, bed rails) close to the patient and in outpatient settings 390 can be contaminated with epidemiologically important microbes (such as VRE and MRSA)47, 390-394; and data showing these organisms survive on various hospital surfaces 395, 396; some researchers have suggested that such surfaces should be disinfected on a regular schedule 378. Spot decontamination on fabrics that remain in hospitals or clinic rooms while patients move in and out (e.g., privacy curtains) also should be considered. One study demonstrated the effectiveness of spraying the fabric with 3% hydrogen peroxide 397. Future studies should evaluate the level of contamination on noncritical environmental surfaces as a function of high and low hand contact and whether some surfaces (e.g., bed rails) near the patient with high contact frequencies require more frequent disinfection. Regardless of whether a detergent or disinfectant is used on surfaces in a health-care facility, surfaces should be cleaned routinely and when dirty or soiled to provide an aesthetically pleasing environment and to prevent potentially contaminated objects from serving as a source for health-care– associated infections. 398 The value of designing surfaces (e.g. hexyl-polyvinylpyridine) that kill bacteria Last update: June 2024 31 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) on contact 399 or have sustained antimicrobial activity 400 should be further evaluated. Several investigators have recognized heavy microbial contamination of wet mops and cleaning cloths and the potential for spread of such contamination 68, 401. They have shown that wiping hard surfaces with contaminated cloths can contaminate hands, equipment, and other surfaces 68, 402. Data have been published that can be used to formulate effective policies for decontamination and maintenance of reusable cleaning cloths. For example, heat was the most reliable treatment of cleaning cloths as a detergent washing followed by drying at 80°C for 2 hours produced elimination of contamination. However, the dry heating process might be a fire hazard if the mop head contains petroleum-based products or lint builds up within the equipment or vent hose (American Health Care Association, personal communication, March 2003). Alternatively, immersing the cloth in hypochlorite (4,000 ppm) for 2 minutes produced no detectable surviving organisms in 10 of 13 cloths 403. If reusable cleaning cloths or mops are used, they should be decontaminated regularly to prevent surface contamination during cleaning with subsequent transfer of organisms from these surfaces to patients or equipment by the hands of health-care workers.

If reusable cleaning cloths or mops are used, they should be decontaminated regularly to prevent surface contamination during cleaning with subsequent transfer of organisms from these surfaces to patients or equipment by the hands of health-care workers. Some hospitals have begun using a new mopping technique involving microfiber materials to clean floors. Microfibers are densely constructed, polyester and polyamide (nylon) fibers, that are approximately 1/16 the thickness of a human hair. The positively charged microfibers attract dust (which has a negative charge) and are more absorbent than a conventional, cotton-loop mop. Microfiber materials also can be wet with disinfectants, such as quaternary ammonium compounds. In one study, the microfiber system tested demonstrated superior microbial removal compared with conventional string mops when used with a detergent cleaner (94% vs 68%). The use of a disinfectant did not improve the microbial elimination demonstrated by the microfiber system (95% vs 94%). However, use of disinfectant significantly improved microbial removal when a conventional string mop was used (95% vs 68%) (WA Rutala, unpublished data, August 2006). The microfiber system also prevents the possibility of transferring microbes from room to room because a new microfiber pad is used in each room. An important issue concerning use of disinfectants for noncritical surfaces in health-care settings is that the contact time specified on the label of the product is often too long to be practically followed. The labels of most products registered by EPA for use against HBV, HIV, or M. tuberculosis specify a contact time of 10 minutes. Such a long contact time is not practical for disinfection of environmental surfaces in a health-care setting because most health-care facilities apply a disinfectant and allow it to dry (~1 minute). Multiple scientific papers have demonstrated significant microbial reduction with contact times of 30 to 60 seconds46-56, 58-64. In addition, EPA will approve a shortened contact time for any product for which the manufacturers will submit confirmatory efficacy data. Currently, some EPA-registered disinfectants have contact times of one to three minutes. By law, users must follow all applicable label instructions for EPA-registered products. Ideally, product users should consider and use products that have the shortened contact time. However, disinfectant manufacturers also need to obtain EPA approval for shortened contact times so these products will be used correctly and effectively in the health-care environment.

Last update: June 2024 32 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Microbial Contamination of Disinfectants Contaminated disinfectants and antiseptics have been occasional vehicles of health-care infections and pseudoepidemics for more than 50 years. Published reports describing contaminated disinfectants and antiseptic solutions leading to health-care-associated infections have been summarized 404. Since this summary additional reports have been published 405-408. An examination of reports of disinfectants contaminated with microorganisms revealed noteworthy observations. Perhaps most importantly, high- level disinfectants/liquid chemical sterilants have not been associated with outbreaks due to intrinsic or extrinsic contamination.Members of the genus Pseudomonas (e.g., P. aeruginosa) are the most frequent isolates from contaminated disinfectants—recovered from 80% of contaminated products. Their ability to remain viable or grow in use-dilutions of disinfectants is unparalleled. This survival advantage for Pseudomonas results presumably from their nutritional versatility, their unique outer membrane that constitutes an effective barrier to the passage of germicides, and/or efflux systems 409. Although the concentrated solutions of the disinfectants have not been demonstrated to be contaminated at the point of manufacture, an undiluted phenolic can be contaminated by a Pseudomonas sp. during use 410. In most of the reports that describe illness associated with contaminated disinfectants, the product was used to disinfect patient-care equipment, such as cystoscopes, cardiac catheters, and thermometers. Germicides used as disinfectants that were reported to have been contaminated include chlorhexidine, quaternary ammonium compounds, phenolics, and pine oil. The following control measures should be instituted to reduce the frequency of bacterial growth in disinfectants and the threat of serious healthcare–associated infections from the use of such contaminated products 404. First, some disinfectants should not be diluted; those that are diluted must be prepared correctly to achieve the manufacturers’ recommended use-dilution. Second, infection-control professionals must learn from the literature what inappropriate activities result in extrinsic contamination (i.e., at the point of use) of germicides and train users to prevent recurrence. Common sources of extrinsic contamination of germicides in the reviewed literature are the water to make working dilutions, contaminated containers, and general contamination of the hospital areas where the germicides are prepared and/or used. Third, stock solutions of germicides must be stored as indicated on the product label. EPA verifies manufacturers’ efficacy claims against microorganisms. These measures should provide assurance that products meeting the EPA registration requirements can achieve a certain level of antimicrobial activity when used as directed.

Last update: June 2024 33 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Factors Affecting the Efficacy of Disinfection and Sterilization The activity of germicides against microorganisms depends on a number of factors, some of which are intrinsic qualities of the organism, others of which are the chemical and external physical environment. Awareness of these factors should lead to better use of disinfection and sterilization processes and will be briefly reviewed. More extensive consideration of these and other factors is available elsewhere 13, 14, 16, 411-413. Number and Location of Microorganisms All other conditions remaining constant, the larger the number of microbes, the more time a germicide needs to destroy all of them. Spaulding illustrated this relation when he employed identical test conditions and demonstrated that it took 30 minutes to kill 10 B. atrophaeus (formerly Bacillus subtilis) spores but 3 hours to kill 100,000 Bacillus atrophaeus spores. This reinforces the need for scrupulous cleaning of medical instruments before disinfection and sterilization. Reducing the number of microorganisms that must be inactivated through meticulous cleaning, increases the margin of safety when the germicide is used according to the labeling and shortens the exposure time required to kill the entire microbial load. Researchers also have shown that aggregated or clumped cells are more difficult to inactivate than monodispersed cells 414. The location of microorganisms also must be considered when factors affecting the efficacy of germicides are assessed. Medical instruments with multiple pieces must be disassembled and equipment such as endoscopes that have crevices, joints, and channels are more difficult to disinfect than are flat- surface equipment because penetration of the disinfectant of all parts of the equipment is more difficult. Only surfaces that directly contact the germicide will be disinfected, so there must be no air pockets and the equipment must be completely immersed for the entire exposure period. Manufacturers should be encouraged to produce equipment engineered for ease of cleaning and disinfection. Innate Resistance of Microorganisms Microorganisms vary greatly in their resistance to chemical germicides and sterilization processes (Figure 1) 342 Intrinsic resistance mechanisms in microorganisms to disinfectants vary. For example, spores are resistant to disinfectants because the spore coat and cortex act as a barrier, mycobacteria have a waxy cell wall that prevents disinfectant entry, and gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane that acts as a barrier to the uptake of disinfectants 341, 343-345. Implicit in all disinfection strategies is the consideration that the most resistant microbial subpopulation controls the sterilization or disinfection time. That is, to destroy the most resistant types of microorganisms (i.e., bacterial spores), the user needs to employ", "page_start": 34, "page_end": 34, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

Implicit in all disinfection strategies is the consideration that the most resistant microbial subpopulation controls the sterilization or disinfection time. That is, to destroy the most resistant types of microorganisms (i.e., bacterial spores), the user needs to employ exposure times and a concentration of germicide needed to achieve complete destruction. Except for prions, bacterial spores possess the highest innate resistance to chemical germicides, followed by coccidia (e.g., Cryptosporidium), mycobacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis), nonlipid or small viruses (e.g., poliovirus, and coxsackievirus), fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, and Candida), vegetative bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas) and lipid or medium-size viruses (e.g., herpes, and HIV). The germicidal resistance exhibited by the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is similar with some exceptions (e.g., P. aeruginosa which shows greater resistance to some disinfectants) 369, 415, 416. P. aeruginosa also is significantly more resistant to a variety of disinfectants in its “naturally occurring” state than are cells subcultured on laboratory media 415, 417. Rickettsiae, Chlamydiae, and mycoplasma cannot be placed in this scale of relative resistance because information about the efficacy of germicides against these agents is limited 418. Because these microorganisms contain lipid and are similar in structure and composition to other bacteria, they can be predicted to be inactivated by the same germicides that destroy lipid viruses and vegetative bacteria. A known exception to this supposition is Coxiella burnetti, which has demonstrated resistance to disinfectants 419. Last update: June 2024 34 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Concentration and Potency of Disinfectants With other variables constant, and with one exception (iodophors), the more concentrated the disinfectant, the greater its efficacy and the shorter the time necessary to achieve microbial kill. Generally not recognized, however, is that all disinfectants are not similarly affected by concentration adjustments. For example, quaternary ammonium compounds and phenol have a concentration exponent of 1 and 6, respectively; thus, halving the concentration of a quaternary ammonium compound requires doubling its disinfecting time, but halving the concentration of a phenol solution requires a 64-fold (i.e., 26) increase in its disinfecting time 365, 413, 420. Considering the length of the disinfection time, which depends on the potency of the germicide, also is important. This was illustrated by Spaulding who demonstrated using the mucin-loop test that 70% isopropyl alcohol destroyed 104 M. tuberculosis in 5 minutes, whereas a simultaneous test with 3% phenolic required 2–3 hours to achieve the same level of microbial kill 14. Physical and Chemical Factors Several physical and chemical factors also influence disinfectant procedures: temperature, pH, relative humidity, and water hardness. For example, the activity of most disinfectants increases as the temperature increases, but some exceptions exist.

For example, the activity of most disinfectants increases as the temperature increases, but some exceptions exist. Furthermore, too great an increase in temperature causes the disinfectant to degrade and weakens its germicidal activity and thus might produce a potential health hazard. An increase in pH improves the antimicrobial activity of some disinfectants (e.g., glutaraldehyde, quaternary ammonium compounds) but decreases the antimicrobial activity of others (e.g., phenols, hypochlorites, and iodine). The pH influences the antimicrobial activity by altering the disinfectant molecule or the cell surface 413. Relative humidity is the single most important factor influencing the activity of gaseous disinfectants/sterilants, such as EtO, chlorine dioxide, and formaldehyde. Water hardness (i.e., high concentration of divalent cations) reduces the rate of kill of certain disinfectants because divalent cations (e.g., magnesium, calcium) in the hard water interact with the disinfectant to form insoluble precipitates 13, 421. Organic and Inorganic Matter Organic matter in the form of serum, blood, pus, or fecal or lubricant material can interfere with the antimicrobial activity of disinfectants in at least two ways. Most commonly, interference occurs by a chemical reaction between the germicide and the organic matter resulting in a complex that is less germicidal or nongermicidal, leaving less of the active germicide available for attacking microorganisms. Chlorine and iodine disinfectants, in particular, are prone to such interaction. Alternatively, organic material can protect microorganisms from attack by acting as a physical barrier 422, 423. The effects of inorganic contaminants on the sterilization process were studied during the 1950s and 1960s 424, 425. These and other studies show the protection by inorganic contaminants of microorganisms to all sterilization processes results from occlusion in salt crystals 426, 427. This further emphasizes the importance of meticulous cleaning of medical devices before any sterilization or disinfection procedure because both organic and inorganic soils are easily removed by washing 426. Duration of Exposure Items must be exposed to the germicide for the appropriate minimum contact time. Multiple investigators have demonstrated the effectiveness of low-level disinfectants against vegetative bacteria (e.g., Listeria, E. coli, Salmonella, VRE, MRSA), yeasts (e.g., Candida), mycobacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis), and viruses (e.g., poliovirus) at exposure times of 30–60 seconds 46-64.

All lumens and channels of endoscopic instruments must contact the disinfectant. Air pockets interfere with the disinfection process, and items that float on the disinfectant will not be disinfected. The disinfectant must be introduced reliably into the internal channels of the device. The exact times for disinfecting medical items are somewhat elusive because of the effect of the aforementioned factors on disinfection efficacy. Certain contact times have proved reliable (Table 1), but, in general, longer contact times are more effective than shorter contact times. Biofilms Microorganisms may be protected from disinfectants by production of thick masses of cells 428 and extracellular materials, or biofilms 429-435. Biofilms are microbial communities that are tightly attached to surfaces and cannot be easly removed. Once these masses form, microbes within them can be resistant to disinfectants by multiple mechanisms, including physical characteristics of older biofilms, genotypic variation of the bacteria, microbial production of neutralizing enzymes, and physiologic gradients within the biofilm (e.g., pH). Bacteria within biofilms are up to 1,000 times more resistant to antimicrobials than are the same bacteria in suspension 436. Although new decontamination methods 437 are being investigated for removing biofilms, chlorine and monochloramines can effectively inactivate biofilm bacteria 431 438. Investigators have hypothesized that the glycocalyx-like cellular masses on the interior walls of polyvinyl chloride pipe would protect embedded organisms from some disinfectants and be a reservoir for continuous contamination 429, 430, 439. Biofilms have been found in whirlpools 440, dental unit waterlines441, and numerous medical devices (e.g., contact lenses, pacemakers, hemodialysis systems, urinary catheters, central venous catheters, endoscopes) 434, 436, 438, 442. Their presence can have serious implications for immunocompromised patients and patients who have indwelling medical devices. Some enzymes 436, 443, 444 and detergents 436 can degrade biofilms or reduce numbers of viable bacteria within a biofilm, but no products are EPA-registered or FDA-cleared for this purpose. Last update: June 2024 36 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Cleaning Cleaning is the removal of foreign material (e.g., soil, and organic material) from objects and is normally accomplished using water with detergents or enzymatic products. Thorough cleaning is required before high-level disinfection and sterilization because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of instruments interfere with the effectiveness of these processes. Also, if soiled materials dry or bake onto the instruments, the removal process becomes more difficult and the disinfection or sterilization process less effective or ineffective.

Surgical instruments should be presoaked or rinsed to prevent drying of blood and to soften or remove blood from the instruments. Cleaning is done manually in use areas without mechanical units (e.g., ultrasonic cleaners or washer- disinfectors) or for fragile or difficult-to-clean instruments. With manual cleaning, the two essential components are friction and fluidics. Friction (e.g., rubbing/scrubbing the soiled area with a brush) is an old and dependable method. Fluidics (i.e., fluids under pressure) is used to remove soil and debris from internal channels after brushing and when the design does not allow passage of a brush through a channel 445. When a washer-disinfector is used, care should be taken in loading instruments: hinged instruments should be opened fully to allow adequate contact with the detergent solution; stacking of instruments in washers should be avoided; and instruments should be disassembled as much as possible. The most common types of mechanical or automatic cleaners are ultrasonic cleaners, washer- decontaminators, washer-disinfectors, and washer-sterilizers. Ultrasonic cleaning removes soil by cavitation and implosion in which waves of acoustic energy are propagated in aqueous solutions to disrupt the bonds that hold particulate matter to surfaces. Bacterial contamination can be present in used ultrasonic cleaning solutions (and other used detergent solutions) because these solutions generally do not make antibacterial label claims 446. Even though ultrasound alone does not significantly inactivate bacteria, sonication can act synergistically to increase the cidal efficacy of a disinfectant 447. Users of ultrasonic cleaners should be aware that the cleaning fluid could result in endotoxin contamination of surgical instruments, which could cause severe inflammatory reactions 448. Washer-sterilizers are modified steam sterilizers that clean by filling the chamber with water and detergent through which steam passes to provide agitation. Instruments are subsequently rinsed and subjected to a short steam- sterilization cycle. Another washer-sterilizer employs rotating spray arms for a wash cycle followed by a steam sterilization cycle at 285°F 449, 450. Washer-decontaminators/disinfectors act like a dishwasher that uses a combination of water circulation and detergents to remove soil. These units sometimes have a cycle that subjects the instruments to a heat process (e.g., 93oC for 10 minutes) 451. Washer-disinfectors are generally computer-controlled units for cleaning, disinfecting, and drying solid and hollow surgical and medical equipment. In one study, cleaning (measured as 5–6 log10 reduction) was achieved on surfaces that had adequate contact with the water flow in the machine 452. Detailed information about cleaning and preparing supplies for terminal sterilization is provided by professional organizations 453, 454 and books 455. Studies have shown that manual and mechanical cleaning of endoscopes achieves approximately a 4- log10 reduction of contaminating organisms 83, 104, 456, 457.

In a quantitative analysis of residual protein contamination of reprocessed surgical instruments, median levels of residual protein contamination per instrument for five trays were 267, 260, 163, 456, and 756 μg 458. In another study, the median amount of protein from reprocessed surgical instruments from different hospitals ranged from 8 μg to 91 μg 459. When manual methods were compared with automated methods for cleaning reusable accessory devices used for minimally invasive surgical procedures, the automated method was more efficient for cleaning biopsy forceps and ported and nonported laparoscopic devices and achieved a >99% reduction in soil parameters (i.e., protein, carbohydrate, hemoglobin) in the ported and nonported laparoscopic devices 460, 461 For instrument cleaning, a neutral or near-neutral pH detergent solution commonly is used because such solutions generally provide the best material compatibility profile and good soil removal. Enzymes, Last update: June 2024 37 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) usually proteases, sometimes are added to neutral pH solutions to assist in removing organic material. Enzymes in these formulations attack proteins that make up a large portion of common soil (e.g., blood, pus). Cleaning solutions also can contain lipases (enzymes active on fats) and amylases (enzymes active on starches). Enzymatic cleaners are not disinfectants, and proteinaceous enzymes can be inactivated by germicides. As with all chemicals, enzymes must be rinsed from the equipment or adverse reactions (e.g., fever, residual amounts of high-level disinfectants, proteinaceous residue) could result 462, 463. Enzyme solutions should be used in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions, which include proper dilution of the enzymatic detergent and contact with equipment for the amount of time specified on the label 463. Detergent enzymes can result in asthma or other allergic effects in users. Neutral pH detergent solutions that contain enzymes are compatible with metals and other materials used in medical instruments and are the best choice for cleaning delicate medical instruments, especially flexible endoscopes 457. Alkaline- based cleaning agents are used for processing medical devices because they efficiently dissolve protein and fat residues 464; however, they can be corrosive 457. Some data demonstrate that enzymatic cleaners are more effective than neutral detergents 465, 466 in removing microorganisms from surfaces but two more recent studies found no difference in cleaning efficiency between enzymatic and alkaline-based cleaners 443, 464. Another study found no significant difference between enzymatic and non-enzymatic cleaners in terms of microbial cleaning efficacy 467.

Although the effectiveness of high-level disinfection and sterilization mandates effective cleaning, no “real-time” tests exist that can be employed in a clinical setting to verify cleaning. If such tests were commercially available they could be used to ensure an adequate level of cleaning.469-472 The only way to ensure adequate cleaning is to conduct a reprocessing verification test (e.g., microbiologic sampling), but this is not routinely recommended 473. Validation of the cleaning processes in a laboratory-testing program is possible by microorganism detection, chemical detection for organic contaminants, radionuclide tagging, and chemical detection for specific ions 426, 471. During the past few years, data have been published describing use of an artificial soil, protein, endotoxin, X-ray contrast medium, or blood to verify the manual or automated cleaning process 169, 452, 474-478 and adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence and microbiologic sampling to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental surface cleaning170, 479. At a minimum, all instruments should be individually inspected and be visibly clean. Last update: June 2024 38 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Disinfection Many disinfectants are used alone or in combinations (e.g., hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid) in the health-care setting. These include alcohols, chlorine and chlorine compounds, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, ortho-phthalaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, peracetic acid, phenolics, and quaternary ammonium compounds. Commercial formulations based on these chemicals are considered unique products and must be registered with EPA or cleared by FDA. In most instances, a given product is designed for a specific purpose and is to be used in a certain manner. Therefore, users should read labels carefully to ensure the correct product is selected for the intended use and applied efficiently. Disinfectants are not interchangeable, and incorrect concentrations and inappropriate disinfectants can result in excessive costs. Because occupational diseases among cleaning personnel have been associated with use of several disinfectants (e.g., formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and chlorine), precautions (e.g., gloves and proper ventilation) should be used to minimize exposure 318, 480, 481. Asthma and reactive airway disease can occur in sensitized persons exposed to any airborne chemical, including germicides.

The following overview of the performance characteristics of each provides users with sufficient information to select an appropriate disinfectant for any item and use it in the most efficient way. Chemical Disinfectants Alcohol Overview. In the healthcare setting, “alcohol” refers to two water-soluble chemical compounds—ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol—that have generally underrated germicidal characteristics 482. FDA has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilant or high-level disinfectant with alcohol as the main active ingredient. These alcohols are rapidly bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic against vegetative forms of bacteria; they also are tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and virucidal but do not destroy bacterial spores. Their cidal activity drops sharply when diluted below 50% concentration, and the optimum bactericidal concentration is 60%–90% solutions in water (volume/volume) 483, 484. Mode of Action. The most feasible explanation for the antimicrobial action of alcohol is denaturation of proteins. This mechanism is supported by the observation that absolute ethyl alcohol, a dehydrating agent, is less bactericidal than mixtures of alcohol and water because proteins are denatured more quickly in the presence of water 484, 485. Protein denaturation also is consistent with observations that alcohol destroys the dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli 486, and that ethyl alcohol increases the lag phase of Enterobacter aerogenes 487 and that the lag phase effect could be reversed by adding certain amino acids. The bacteriostatic action was believed caused by inhibition of the production of metabolites essential for rapid cell division. Microbicidal Activity. Methyl alcohol (methanol) has the weakest bactericidal action of the alcohols and thus seldom is used in healthcare 488. The bactericidal activity of various concentrations of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) was examined against a variety of microorganisms in exposure periods ranging from 10 seconds to 1 hour 483. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 30% to 100% (v/v), and Serratia marcescens, E, coli and Salmonella typhosa were killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 40% to 100%. The gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were slightly more resistant, being killed in 10 seconds by ethyl alcohol concentrations of 60%–95%. Isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) was slightly more bactericidal than ethyl alcohol for E. coli and S. aureus 489. Ethyl alcohol, at concentrations of 60%–80%, is a potent virucidal agent inactivating all of the lipophilic viruses (e.g., herpes, vaccinia, and influenza virus) and many hydrophilic viruses (e.g., Last update: June 2024 39 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and rotaviruses but not hepatitis A virus (HAV) 58 or poliovirus) 49.

Isopropyl alcohol is not active against the nonlipid enteroviruses but is fully active against the lipid viruses 72.Studies also have demonstrated the ability of ethyl and isopropyl alcohol to inactivate the hepatitis B virus(HBV) 224, 225 and the herpes virus, 490 and ethyl alcohol to inactivate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 227, rotavirus, echovirus, and astrovirus 491. In tests of the effect of ethyl alcohol against M. tuberculosis, 95% ethanol killed the tubercle bacilli in sputum or water suspension within 15 seconds 492. In 1964, Spaulding stated that alcohols were the germicide of choice for tuberculocidal activity, and they should be the standard by which all other tuberculocides are compared. For example, he compared the tuberculocidal activity of iodophor (450 ppm), a substituted phenol (3%), and isopropanol (70%/volume) using the mucin-loop test (106 M. tuberculosis per loop) and determined the contact times needed for complete destruction were 120– 180 minutes, 45–60 minutes, and 5 minutes, respectively. The mucin-loop test is a severe test developed to produce long survival times. Thus, these figures should not be extrapolated to the exposure times needed when these germicides are used on medical or surgical material 482. Ethyl alcohol (70%) was the most effective concentration for killing the tissue phase of Cryptococcus neoformans, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, and Histoplasma capsulatum and the culture phases of the latter three organisms aerosolized onto various surfaces. The culture phase was more resistant to the action of ethyl alcohol and required about 20 minutes to disinfect the contaminated surface, compared with <1 minute for the tissue phase 493, 494. Isopropyl alcohol (20%) is effective in killing the cysts of Acanthamoeba culbertsoni (560) as are chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, and thimerosal 496. Uses. Alcohols are not recommended for sterilizing medical and surgical materials principally because they lack sporicidal action and they cannot penetrate protein-rich materials. Fatal postoperative wound infections with Clostridium have occurred when alcohols were used to sterilize surgical instruments contaminated with bacterial spores 497. Alcohols have been used effectively to disinfect oral and rectal thermometers498, 499, hospital pagers 500, scissors 501, and stethoscopes 502. Alcohols have been used to disinfect fiberoptic endoscopes 503, 504 but failure of this disinfectant have lead to infection 280, 505. Alcohol towelettes have been used for years to disinfect small surfaces such as rubber stoppers of multiple-dose medication vials or vaccine bottles. Furthermore, alcohol occasionally is used to disinfect external surfaces of equipment (e.g., stethoscopes, ventilators, manual ventilation bags) 506, CPR manikins 507, ultrasound instruments 508 or medication preparation areas.

In contrast, three bloodstream infection outbreaks have been described when alcohol was used to disinfect transducer heads in an intensive- care setting 511. The documented shortcomings of alcohols on equipment are that they damage the shellac mountings of lensed instruments, tend to swell and harden rubber and certain plastic tubing after prolonged and repeated use, bleach rubber and plastic tiles 482 and damage tonometer tips (by deterioration of the glue) after the equivalent of 1 working year of routine use 512. Tonometer biprisms soaked in alcohol for 4 days developed rough front surfaces that potentially could cause corneal damage; this appeared to be caused by weakening of the cementing substances used to fabricate the biprisms 513. Corneal opacification has been reported when tonometer tips were swabbed with alcohol immediately before measurement of intraocular pressure 514. Alcohols are flammable and consequently must be stored in a cool, well-ventilated area. They also evaporate rapidly, making extended exposure time difficult to achieve unless the items are immersed. Chlorine and Chlorine Compounds Overview. Hypochlorites, the most widely used of the chlorine disinfectants, are available as liquid (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) or solid (e.g., calcium hypochlorite). The most prevalent chlorine products in Last update: June 2024 40 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) the United States are aqueous solutions of 5.25%–6.15% sodium hypochlorite (see glossary), usually called household bleach. They have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, do not leave toxic residues, are unaffected by water hardness, are inexpensive and fast acting 328, remove dried or fixed organisms and biofilms from surfaces465, and have a low incidence of serious toxicity 515-517. Sodium hypochlorite at the concentration used in household bleach (5.25-6.15%) can produce ocular irritation or oropharyngeal, esophageal, and gastric burns 318, 518-522. Other disadvantages of hypochlorites include corrosiveness to metals in high concentrations (>500 ppm), inactivation by organic matter, discoloring or “bleaching” of fabrics, release of toxic chlorine gas when mixed with ammonia or acid (e.g., household cleaning agents) 523-525, and relative stability 327. The microbicidal activity of chlorine is attributed largely to undissociated hypochlorous acid (HOCl). The dissociation of HOCI to the less microbicidal form (hypochlorite ion OCl-) depends on pH. The disinfecting efficacy of chlorine decreases with an increase in pH that parallels the conversion of undissociated HOCI to OCl- 329, 526.

A potential hazard is production of the carcinogen bis(chloromethyl) ether when hypochlorite solutions contact formaldehyde 527 and the production of the animal carcinogen trihalomethane when hot water is hyperchlorinated 528. After reviewing environmental fate and ecologic data, EPA has determined the currently registered uses of hypochlorites will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to the environment 529. Alternative compounds that release chlorine and are used in the health-care setting include demand- release chlorine dioxide, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, and chloramine-T. The advantage of these compounds over the hypochlorites is that they retain chlorine longer and so exert a more prolonged bactericidal effect. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate tablets are stable, and for two reasons, the microbicidal activity of solutions prepared from sodium dichloroisocyanurate tablets might be greater than that of sodium hypochlorite solutions containing the same total available chlorine. First, with sodium dichloroisocyanurate, only 50% of the total available chlorine is free (HOCl and OCl-), whereas the remainder is combined (monochloroisocyanurate or dichloroisocyanurate), and as free available chlorine is used up, the latter is released to restore the equilibrium. Second, solutions of sodium dichloroisocyanurate are acidic, whereas sodium hypochlorite solutions are alkaline, and the more microbicidal type of chlorine (HOCl) is believed to predominate 530-533. Chlorine dioxide-based disinfectants are prepared fresh as required by mixing the two components (base solution [citric acid with preservatives and corrosion inhibitors] and the activator solution [sodium chlorite]). In vitro suspension tests showed that solutions containing about 140 ppm chlorine dioxide achieved a reduction factor exceeding 106 of S. aureus in 1 minute and of Bacillus atrophaeus spores in 2.5 minutes in the presence of 3 g/L bovine albumin. The potential for damaging equipment requires consideration because long-term use can damage the outer plastic coat of the insertion tube 534. In another study, chlorine dioxide solutions at either 600 ppm or 30 ppm killed Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare within 60 seconds after contact but contamination by organic material significantly affected the microbicidal properties535. The microbicidal activity of a new disinfectant, “superoxidized water,” has been examined The concept of electrolyzing saline to create a disinfectant or antiseptics is appealing because the basic materials of saline and electricity are inexpensive and the end product (i.e., water) does not damage the environment. The main products of this water are hypochlorous acid (e.g., at a concentration of about 144 mg/L) and chlorine. As with any germicide, the antimicrobial activity of superoxidized water is strongly affected by the concentration of the active ingredient (available free chlorine) 536. One manufacturer generates the disinfectant at the point of use by passing a saline solution over coated titanium electrodes at 9 amps.

Unfortunately, the equipment required to produce the product can be expensive because parameters such as pH, current, and redox potential must be closely monitored. The solution is nontoxic to biologic tissues. Although the United Kingdom manufacturer claims the solution is noncorrosive and nondamaging to endoscopes and processing equipment, one flexible endoscope manufacturer (Olympus Key-Med, United Kingdom) has voided the warranty on the endoscopes if superoxidized water is used to disinfect them 538.

Additional studies are needed to determine whether this solution could be used as an alternative to other disinfectants or antiseptics for hand washing, skin antisepsis, room cleaning, or equipment disinfection (e.g., endoscopes, dialyzers) 400, 539, 540. In October 2002, the FDA cleared superoxidized water as a high-level disinfectant (FDA, personal communication, September 18, 2002). Mode of Action. The exact mechanism by which free chlorine destroys microorganisms has not been elucidated. Inactivation by chlorine can result from a number of factors: oxidation of sulfhydryl enzymes and amino acids; ring chlorination of amino acids; loss of intracellular contents; decreased uptake of nutrients; inhibition of protein synthesis; decreased oxygen uptake; oxidation of respiratory components; decreased adenosine triphosphate production; breaks in DNA; and depressed DNA synthesis 329, 347. The actual microbicidal mechanism of chlorine might involve a combination of these factors or the effect of chlorine on critical sites 347. Microbicidal Activity. Low concentrations of free available chlorine (e.g., HOCl, OCl-, and elemental chlorine-Cl2) have a biocidal effect on mycoplasma (25 ppm) and vegetative bacteria (<5 ppm) in seconds in the absence of an organic load 329, 418. Higher concentrations (1,000 ppm) of chlorine are required to kill M.tuberculosis using the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) tuberculocidal test 73. A concentration of 100 ppm will kill ≥99.9% of B. atrophaeus spores within 5 minutes 541, 542 and destroy mycotic agents in <1 hour 329. Acidified bleach and regular bleach (5,000 ppm chlorine) can inactivate 106 Clostridium difficile spores in ≤10 minutes 262. One study reported that 25 different viruses were inactivated in 10 minutes with 200 ppm available chlorine 72.

In experiments using the AOAC Use- Dilution Method, 100 ppm of free chlorine killed 106–107 S. aureus, Salmonella choleraesuis, and P. aeruginosa in <10 minutes 327. Because household bleach contains 5.25%–6.15% sodium hypochlorite, or 52,500–61,500 ppm available chlorine, a 1:1,000 dilution provides about 53–62 ppm available chlorine, and a 1:10 dilution of household bleach provides about 5250–6150 ppm. Data are available for chlorine dioxide that support manufacturers' bactericidal, fungicidal, sporicidal, tuberculocidal, and virucidal label claims 543-546. A chlorine dioxide generator has been shown effective for decontaminating flexible endoscopes 534 but it is not currently FDA-cleared for use as a high-level disinfectant 85. Chlorine dioxide can be produced by mixing solutions, such as a solution of chlorine with a solution of sodium chlorite 329. In 1986, a chlorine dioxide product was voluntarily removed from the market when its use caused leakage of cellulose-based dialyzer membranes, which allowed bacteria to migrate from the dialysis fluid side of the dialyzer to the blood side 547. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate at 2,500 ppm available chlorine is effective against bacteria in the presence of up to 20% plasma, compared with 10% plasma for sodium hypochlorite at 2,500 ppm 548. “Superoxidized water” has been tested against bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores 537, 539, 549. Freshly generated superoxidized water is rapidly effective (<2 minutes) in achieving a 5-log10 reduction of pathogenic microorganisms (i.e., M. tuberculosis, M. chelonae, poliovirus, HIV, multidrug- resistant S. aureus, E. coli, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, P. aeruginosa) in the absence of organic loading. However, the biocidal activity of this disinfectant decreased substantially in the presence of organic material (e.g., 5% horse serum) 537, 549, 550. No bacteria or viruses were detected on artificially contaminated endoscopes after a 5-minute exposure to superoxidized water 551 and HBV-DNA was not detected from any endoscope experimentally contaminated with HBV-positive mixed sera after a disinfectant exposure time of 7 minutes552. Uses. Hypochlorites are widely used in healthcare facilities in a variety of settings. 328 Inorganic chlorine solution is used for disinfecting tonometer heads 188 and for spot-disinfection of countertops and floors.

Because hypochlorites and other germicides are substantially inactivated in the presence of blood 63, 548, 555, 556, large spills of blood require that the surface be cleaned before an EPA-registered disinfectant or a 1:10 (final concentration) solution of household bleach is applied 557. If a sharps injury is possible, the surface initially should be decontaminated 69, 318, then cleaned and disinfected (1:10 final concentration) 63.Extreme care always should be taken to prevent percutaneous injury. At least 500 ppm available chlorine for 10 minutes is recommended for decontaminating CPR training manikins 558. Full-strength bleach has been recommended for self-disinfection of needles and syringes used for illicit-drug injection when needle-exchange programs are not available. The difference in the recommended concentrations of bleach reflects the difficulty of cleaning the interior of needles and syringes and the use of needles and syringes for parenteral injection 559. Clinicians should not alter their use of chlorine on environmental surfaces on the basis of testing methodologies that do not simulate actual disinfection practices 560, 561. Other uses in healthcare include as an irrigating agent in endodontic treatment 562 and as a disinfectant for manikins, laundry, dental appliances, hydrotherapy tanks 23, 41, regulated medical waste before disposal 328, and the water distribution system in hemodialysis centers and hemodialysis machines 563. Chlorine long has been used as the disinfectant in water treatment. Hyperchlorination of a Legionella- contaminated hospital water system 23 resulted in a dramatic decrease (from 30% to 1.5%) in the isolation of L. pneumophila from water outlets and a cessation of healthcare-associated Legionnaires' disease in an affected unit 528, 564. Water disinfection with monochloramine by municipal water-treatment plants substantially reduced the risk for healthcare–associated Legionnaires disease 565, 566. Chlorine dioxide also has been used to control Legionella in a hospital water supply. 567 Chloramine T 568 and hypochlorites 41 have been used to disinfect hydrotherapy equipment. Hypochlorite solutions in tap water at a pH >8 stored at room temperature (23oC) in closed, opaque plastic containers can lose up to 40%–50% of their free available chlorine level over 1 month. Thus, if a user wished to have a solution containing 500 ppm of available chlorine at day 30, he or she should prepare a solution containing 1,000 ppm of chlorine at time 0. Sodium hypochlorite solution does not decompose after 30 days when stored in a closed brown bottle 327.

The use of powders, composed of a mixture of a chlorine-releasing agent with highly absorbent resin, for disinfecting spills of body fluids has been evaluated by laboratory tests and hospital ward trials. The inclusion of acrylic resin particles in formulations markedly increases the volume of fluid that can be soaked up because the resin can absorb 200–300 times its own weight of fluid, depending on the fluid consistency. When experimental formulations containing 1%, 5%, and 10% available chlorine were evaluated by a standardized surface test, those containing 10% demonstrated bactericidal activity. One problem with chlorine-releasing granules is that they can generate chlorine fumes when applied to urine 569. Formaldehyde Overview. Formaldehyde is used as a disinfectant and sterilant in both its liquid and gaseous states. Liquid formaldehyde will be considered briefly in this section, and the gaseous form is reviewed elsewhere 570. Formaldehyde is sold and used principally as a water-based solution called formalin, which is 37% formaldehyde by weight. The aqueous solution is a bactericide, tuberculocide, fungicide, virucide and sporicide 72, 82, 571-573. OSHA indicated that formaldehyde should be handled in the workplace as a potential carcinogen and set an employee exposure standard for formaldehyde that limits an 8-hour time- weighted average exposure concentration of 0.75 ppm 574, 575. The standard includes a second permissible exposure limit in the form of a short-term exposure limit (STEL) of 2 ppm that is the maximum exposure allowed during a 15-minute period 576. Ingestion of formaldehyde can be fatal, and long-term exposure to low levels in the air or on the skin can cause asthma-like respiratory problems and skin irritation, such as dermatitis and itching. For these reasons, employees should have limited direct contact Last update: June 2024 43 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) with formaldehyde, and these considerations limit its role in sterilization and disinfection processes. Key provisions of the OSHA standard that protects workers from exposure to formaldehyde appear in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1910.1048 (and equivalent regulations in states with OSHA-approved state plans) 577. Mode of Action. Formaldehyde inactivates microorganisms by alkylating the amino and sulfhydral groups of proteins and ring nitrogen atoms of purine bases 376. Microbicidal Activity. Varying concentrations of aqueous formaldehyde solutions destroy a wide range of microorganisms. Inactivation of poliovirus in 10 minutes required an 8% concentration of formalin, but all other viruses tested were inactivated with 2% formalin 72. Four percent formaldehyde is a tuberculocidal agent, inactivating 104 M. tuberculosis in 2 minutes 82, and 2.5% formaldehyde inactivated about 107 Salmonella Typhi in 10 minutes in the presence of organic matter 572.

The sporicidal action of formaldehyde was slower than that of glutaraldehyde in comparative tests with 4% aqueous formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde against the spores of B. anthracis 82. The formaldehyde solution required 2 hours of contact to achieve an inactivation factor of 104, whereas glutaraldehyde required only 15 minutes. Uses. Although formaldehyde-alcohol is a chemical sterilant and formaldehyde is a high-level disinfectant, the health-care uses of formaldehyde are limited by its irritating fumes and its pungent odor even at very low levels (<1 ppm). For these reasons and others—such as its role as a suspected human carcinogen linked to nasal cancer and lung cancer 578, this germicide is excluded from Table 1. When it is used, , direct exposure to employees generally is limited; however, excessive exposures to formaldehyde have been documented for employees of renal transplant units 574, 579, and students in a gross anatomy laboratory 580. Formaldehyde is used in the health-care setting to prepare viral vaccines (e.g., poliovirus and influenza); as an embalming agent; and to preserve anatomic specimens; and historically has been used to sterilize surgical instruments, especially when mixed with ethanol. A 1997 survey found that formaldehyde was used for reprocessing hemodialyzers by 34% of U.S. hemodialysis centers—a 60% decrease from 1983 249, 581. If used at room temperature, a concentration of 4% with a minimum exposure of 24 hours is required to disinfect disposable hemodialyzers reused on the same patient 582, 583. Aqueous formaldehyde solutions (1%–2%) also have been used to disinfect the internal fluid pathways of dialysis machines 583. To minimize a potential health hazard to dialysis patients, the dialysis equipment must be thoroughly rinsed and tested for residual formaldehyde before use. Paraformaldehyde, a solid polymer of formaldehyde, can be vaporized by heat for the gaseous decontamination of laminar flow biologic safety cabinets when maintenance work or filter changes require access to the sealed portion of the cabinet. Glutaraldehyde Overview. Glutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high-level disinfectant and chemical sterilant 107. Aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde are acidic and generally in this state are not sporicidal. Only when the solution is “activated” (made alkaline) by use of alkalinating agents to pH 7.5–8.5 does the solution become sporicidal. Once activated, these solutions have a shelf-life of minimally 14 days because of the polymerization of the glutaraldehyde molecules at alkaline pH levels. This polymerization blocks the active sites (aldehyde groups) of the glutaraldehyde molecules that are responsible for its biocidal activity. Novel glutaraldehyde formulations (e.g., glutaraldehyde-phenol-sodium phenate, potentiated acid glutaraldehyde, stabilized alkaline glutaraldehyde) produced in the past 30 years have overcome the problem of rapid loss of activity", "page_start": 44, "page_end": 44, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

However, antimicrobial activity depends not only on age but also on use conditions, such as dilution and organic stress. Manufacturers' literature for these preparations suggests the neutral or alkaline glutaraldehydes possess microbicidal and anticorrosion properties superior to Last update: June 2024 44 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) those of acid glutaraldehydes, and a few published reports substantiate these claims 542, 589, 590. However, two studies found no difference in the microbicidal activity of alkaline and acid glutaraldehydes 73, 591. The use of glutaraldehyde-based solutions in health-care facilities is widespread because of their advantages, including excellent biocidal properties; activity in the presence of organic matter (20% bovine serum); and noncorrosive action to endoscopic equipment, thermometers, rubber, or plastic equipment (Tables 4 and 5). Mode of Action. The biocidal activity of glutaraldehyde results from its alkylation of sulfhydryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups of microorganisms, which alters RNA, DNA, and protein synthesis. The mechanism of action of glutaraldehydes are reviewed extensively elsewhere 592, 593. Microbicidal Activity. The in vitro inactivation of microorganisms by glutaraldehydes has been extensively investigated and reviewed 592, 593. Several investigators showed that ≥2% aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde, buffered to pH 7.5–8.5 with sodium bicarbonate effectively killed vegetative bacteria in <2 minutes; M. tuberculosis, fungi, and viruses in <10 minutes; and spores of Bacillus and Clostridium species in 3 hours 542, 592-597. Spores of C. difficile are more rapidly killed by 2% glutaraldehyde than are spores of other species of Clostridium and Bacillus 79, 265, 266. Microorganisms with substantial resistance to glutaraldehyde have been reported, including some mycobacteria (M. chelonae, Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare, M. xenopi) 598-601, Methylobacterium mesophilicum 602, Trichosporon, fungal ascospores (e.g., Microascus cinereus, Cheatomium globosum), and Cryptosporidium271, 603. M. chelonae persisted in a 0.2% glutaraldehyde solution used to store porcine prosthetic heart valves 604. Two percent alkaline glutaraldehyde solution inactivated 105 M. tuberculosis cells on the surface of penicylinders within 5 minutes at 18oC 589. However, subsequent studies82 questioned the mycobactericidal prowess of glutaraldehydes. Two percent alkaline glutaraldehyde has slow action (20 to >30 minutes) against M. tuberculosis and compares unfavorably with alcohols, formaldehydes, iodine, and phenol 82. Suspensions of M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. gordonae were more resistant to inactivation by a 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde (estimated time to complete inactivation: ~60 minutes) than were virulent M. tuberculosis (estimated time to complete inactivation ~25 minutes) 605.

The rate of kill was directly proportional to the temperature, and a standardized suspension of M. tuberculosis could not be sterilized within 10 minutes 84. An FDA-cleared chemical sterilant containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde uses increased temperature (35oC) to reduce the time required to achieve high-level disinfection (5 minutes) 85, 606, but its use is limited to automatic endoscope reprocessors equipped with a heater. In another study employing membrane filters for measurement of mycobactericidal activity of 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde, complete inactivation was achieved within 20 minutes at 20oC when the test inoculum was 106 M. tuberculosis per membrane 81. Several investigators 55, 57, 73, 76, 80, 81, 84, 605 have demonstrated that glutaraldehyde solutions inactivate 2.4 to >5.0 log10 of M. tuberculosis in 10 minutes (including multidrug- resistant M. tuberculosis) and 4.0–6.4 log10 of M. tuberculosis in 20 minutes. On the basis of these data and other studies, 20 minutes at room temperature is considered the minimum exposure time needed to reliably kill Mycobacteria and other vegetative bacteria with ≥2% glutaraldehyde 17, 19, 27, 57, 83, 94, 108, 111, 117- 121, 607. Glutaraldehyde is commonly diluted during use, and studies showed a glutaraldehyde concentration decline after a few days of use in an automatic endoscope washer 608, 609. The decline occurs because instruments are not thoroughly dried and water is carried in with the instrument, which increases the solution’s volume and dilutes its effective concentration 610. This emphasizes the need to ensure that semicritical equipment is disinfected with an acceptable concentration of glutaraldehyde. Data suggest that 1.0%–1.5% glutaraldehyde is the minimum effective concentration for >2% glutaraldehyde solutions when used as a high-level disinfectant 76, 589, 590, 609. Chemical test strips or liquid chemical monitors 610, 611 are available for determining whether an effective concentration of glutaraldehyde is present despite repeated use and dilution. The frequency of testing should be based on how frequently the solutions are used (e.g., used daily, test daily; used weekly, test before use; used 30 times per day, test each 10th use), but the strips should not be used to extend the use life beyond the expiration date.

To ensure the presence of minimum effective concentration of the high-level disinfectant, manufacturers of some chemical test strips recommend the use of quality-control procedures to ensure the strips perform properly. If the manufacturer of the chemical test strip recommends a quality- control procedure, users should comply with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The concentration should be considered unacceptable or unsafe when the test indicates a dilution below the product’s minimum effective concentration (MEC) (generally to ≤1.0%–1.5% glutaraldehyde) by the indicator not changing color. A 2.0% glutaraldehyde–7.05% phenol–1.20% sodium phenate product that contained 0.125% glutaraldehyde–0.44% phenol–0.075% sodium phenate when diluted 1:16 is not recommended as a high- level disinfectant because it lacks bactericidal activity in the presence of organic matter and lacks tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and sporicidal activity 49, 55, 56, 71, 73-79, 614.

Glutaraldehyde is used most commonly as a high-level disinfectant for medical equipment such as endoscopes 69, 107, 504, spirometry tubing, dialyzers 616, transducers, anesthesia and respiratory therapy equipment 617, hemodialysis proportioning and dialysate delivery systems 249, 618, and reuse of laparoscopic disposable plastic trocars 619. Glutaraldehyde is noncorrosive to metal and does not damage lensed instruments, rubber. or plastics. Glutaraldehyde should not be used for cleaning noncritical surfaces because it is too toxic and expensive. Colitis believed caused by glutaraldehyde exposure from residual disinfecting solution in endoscope solution channels has been reported and is preventable by careful endoscope rinsing 318, 620-630. One study found that residual glutaraldehyde levels were higher and more variable after manual disinfection (<0.2 mg/L to 159.5 mg/L) than after automatic disinfection (0.2–6.3 mg/L)631. Similarly, keratopathy and corneal decompensation were caused by ophthalmic instruments that were inadequately rinsed after soaking in 2% glutaraldehyde 632, 633. Healthcare personnel can be exposed to elevated levels of glutaraldehyde vapor when equipment is processed in poorly ventilated rooms, when spills occur, when glutaraldehyde solutions are activated or changed,634, or when open immersion baths are used.

Acute or chronic exposure can result in skin irritation or dermatitis, mucous membrane irritation (eye, nose, mouth), or pulmonary symptoms 318, 635-639. Epistaxis, allergic contact dermatitis, asthma, and rhinitis also have been reported in healthcare workers exposed to glutaraldehyde 636, 640-647. Glutaraldehyde exposure should be monitored to ensure a safe work environment. Testing can be done by four techniques: a silica gel tube/gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector, dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH)-impregnated filter cassette/high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an ultraviolet (UV) detector, a passive badge/HPLC, or a handheld glutaraldehyde air monitor 648. The silica gel tube and the DNPH-impregnated cassette are suitable for monitoring the 0.05 ppm ceiling limit. The passive badge, with a 0.02 ppm limit of detection, is considered marginal at the Americal Council of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) ceiling level. The ceiling level is considered too close to the glutaraldehyde meter’s 0.03 ppm limit of detection to provide confidence in the readings 648. ACGIH does not require a specific monitoring schedule for glutaraldehyde; however, a monitoring schedule is needed to ensure the level is less than the ceiling limit. For example, monitoring Last update: June 2024 46 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) should be done initially to determine glutaraldehyde levels, after procedural or equipment changes, and in response to worker complaints 649. In the absence of an OSHA permissible exposure limit, if the glutaraldehyde level is higher than the ACGIH ceiling limit of 0.05 ppm, corrective action and repeat monitoring would be prudent 649. Engineering and work-practice controls that can be used to resolve these problems include ducted exhaust hoods, air systems that provide 7–15 air exchanges per hour, ductless fume hoods with absorbents for the glutaraldehyde vapor, tight-fitting lids on immersion baths, personal protection (e.g., nitrile or butyl rubber gloves but not natural latex gloves, goggles) to minimize skin or mucous membrane contact, and automated endoscope processors 7, 650. If engineering controls fail to maintain levels below the ceiling limit, institutions can consider the use of respirators (e.g., a half-face respirator with organic vapor cartridge 640 or a type \"C\" supplied air respirator with a full facepiece operated in a positive pressure mode) 651. In general, engineering controls are preferred over work-practice and administrative controls because they do not require active participation by the health-care worker. Even though enforcement of the OSHA ceiling limit was suspended in 1993 by the U.S. Court of Appeals 577, limiting employee exposure to 0.05 ppm (according to ACGIH) is prudent because, at this level, glutaraldehyde can irritate the eyes, throat, and nose 318, 577, 639, 652.

If glutaraldehyde disposal through the sanitary sewer system is restricted, sodium bisulfate can be used to neutralize the glutaraldehyde and make it safe for disposal. Hydrogen Peroxide Overview. The literature contains several accounts of the properties, germicidal effectiveness, and potential uses for stabilized hydrogen peroxide in the health-care setting. Published reports ascribe good germicidal activity to hydrogen peroxide and attest to its bactericidal, virucidal, sporicidal, and fungicidal properties 653-655. (Tables 4 and 5) The FDA website lists cleared liquid chemical sterilants and high-level disinfectants containing hydrogen peroxide and their cleared contact conditions. Mode of Action. Hydrogen peroxide works by producing destructive hydroxyl free radicals that can attack membrane lipids, DNA, and other essential cell components. Catalase, produced by aerobic organisms and facultative anaerobes that possess cytochrome systems, can protect cells from metabolically produced hydrogen peroxide by degrading hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. This defense is overwhelmed by the concentrations used for disinfection 653, 654. Microbicidal Activity. Hydrogen peroxide is active against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, and spores 78, 654. A 0.5% accelerated hydrogen peroxide demonstrated bactericidal and virucidal activity in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal activity in 5 minutes 656. Bactericidal effectiveness and stability of hydrogen peroxide in urine has been demonstrated against a variety of health-care–associated pathogens; organisms with high cellular catalase activity (e.g., S. aureus, S. marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis) required 30–60 minutes of exposure to 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for a 108 reduction in cell counts, whereas organisms with lower catalase activity (e.g., E. coli, Streptococcus species, and Pseudomonas species) required only 15 minutes’ exposure 657. In an investigation of 3%, 10%, and 15% hydrogen peroxide for reducing spacecraft bacterial populations, a complete kill of 106 spores (i.e., Bacillus species) occurred with a 10% concentration and a 60-minute exposure time. A 3% concentration for 150 minutes killed 106 spores in six of seven exposure trials 658. A 10% hydrogen peroxide solution resulted in a 103 decrease in B. atrophaeus spores, and a ≥105 decrease when tested against 13 other pathogens in 30 minutes at 20oC 659, 660. A 3.0% hydrogen peroxide solution was ineffective against VRE after 3 and 10 minutes exposure times 661 and caused only a 2-log10 reduction in the number of Acanthamoeba cysts in approximately 2 hours 662. A 7% stabilized hydrogen peroxide proved to be sporicidal (6 hours of exposure), mycobactericidal (20 minutes), fungicidal (5 minutes) at full strength, virucidal (5 minutes) and bactericidal (3 minutes) at a 1:16 dilution when a quantitative carrier test was used 655.

The 7% solution of hydrogen peroxide, tested after 14 days of stress (in the form of germ-loaded carriers and respiratory therapy equipment), was sporicidal (>7 log10 reduction in 6 hours), mycobactericidal (>6.5 log10 reduction in 25 Last update: June 2024 47 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) minutes), fungicidal (>5 log10 reduction in 20 minutes), bactericidal (>6 log10 reduction in 5 minutes) and virucidal (5 log10 reduction in 5 minutes) 663. Synergistic sporicidal effects were observed when spores were exposed to a combination of hydrogen peroxide (5.9%–23.6%) and peracetic acid 664. Other studies demonstrated the antiviral activity of hydrogen peroxide against rhinovirus 665. The time required for inactivating three serotypes of rhinovirus using a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution was 6–8 minutes; this time increased with decreasing concentrations (18-20 minutes at 1.5%, 50–60 minutes at 0.75%). Concentrations of hydrogen peroxide from 6% to 25% show promise as chemical sterilants. The product marketed as a sterilant is a premixed, ready-to-use chemical that contains 7.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.85% phosphoric acid (to maintain a low pH) 69. The mycobactericidal activity of 7.5% hydrogen peroxide has been corroborated in a study showing the inactivation of >105 multidrug-resistant M.tuberculosis after a 10-minute exposure 666. Thirty minutes were required for >99.9% inactivation of poliovirus and HAV 667. Three percent and 6% hydrogen peroxide were unable to inactivate HAV in 1 minute in a carrier test 58. When the effectiveness of 7.5% hydrogen peroxide at 10 minutes was compared with 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde at 20 minutes in manual disinfection of endoscopes, no significant difference in germicidal activity was observed 668. ). No complaints were received from the nursing or medical staff regarding odor or toxicity. In one study, 6% hydrogen peroxide (unused product was 7.5%) was more effective in the high-level disinfection of flexible endoscopes than was the 2% glutaraldehyde solution 456. A new, rapid-acting 13.4% hydrogen peroxide formulation (that is not yet FDA-cleared) has demonstrated sporicidal, mycobactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal efficacy. Manufacturer data demonstrate that this solution sterilizes in 30 minutes and provides high-level disinfection in 5 minutes669.

Commercially available 3% hydrogen peroxide is a stable and effective disinfectant when used on inanimate surfaces. It has been used in concentrations from 3% to 6% for disinfecting soft contact lenses (e.g., 3% for 2–3 hrs) 653, 671, 672, tonometer biprisms 513, ventilators 673, fabrics 397, and endoscopes 456.Hydrogen peroxide was effective in spot-disinfecting fabrics in patients’ rooms 397. Corneal damage from a hydrogen peroxide-soaked tonometer tip that was not properly rinsed has been reported 674. Hydrogen peroxide also has been instilled into urinary drainage bags in an attempt to eliminate the bag as a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination 675. Although the instillation of hydrogen peroxide into the bag reduced microbial contamination of the bag, this procedure did not reduce the incidence of catheter-associated bacteriuria 675. A chemical irritation resembling pseudomembranous colitis caused by either 3% hydrogen peroxide or a 2% glutaraldehyde has been reported 621. An epidemic of pseudomembrane-like enteritis and colitis in seven patients in a gastrointestinal endoscopy unit also has been associated with inadequate rinsing of 3% hydrogen peroxide from the endoscope 676. As with other chemical sterilants, dilution of the hydrogen peroxide must be monitored by regularly testing the minimum effective concentration (i.e., 7.5%–6.0%). Compatibility testing by Olympus America of the 7.5% hydrogen peroxide found both cosmetic changes (e.g., discoloration of black anodized metal finishes) 69 and functional changes with the tested endoscopes (Olympus, written communication, October 15, 1999). Iodophors Overview. Iodine solutions or tinctures long have been used by health professionals primarily as antiseptics on skin or tissue. Iodophors, on the other hand, have been used both as antiseptics and Last update: June 2024 48 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) disinfectants. FDA has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilant or high-level disinfectants with iodophors as the main active ingredient. An iodophor is a combination of iodine and a solubilizing agent or carrier; the resulting complex provides a sustained-release reservoir of iodine and releases small amounts of free iodine in aqueous solution. The best-known and most widely used iodophor is povidone-iodine, a compound of polyvinylpyrrolidone with iodine. This product and other iodophors retain the germicidal efficacy of iodine but unlike iodine generally are nonstaining and relatively free of toxicity and irritancy 677, 678. Several reports that documented intrinsic microbial contamination of antiseptic formulations of povidone-iodine and poloxamer-iodine 679-681 caused a reappraisal of the chemistry and use of iodophors682. “Free” iodine (I2) contributes to the bactericidal activity of iodophors and dilutions of iodophors demonstrate more rapid bactericidal action than does a full-strength povidone-iodine solution.

The reason for the observation that dilution increases bactericidal activity is unclear, but dilution of povidone-iodine might weaken the iodine linkage to the carrier polymer with an accompanying increase of free iodine in solution 680. Therefore, iodophors must be diluted according to the manufacturers' directions to achieve antimicrobial activity. Mode of Action. Iodine can penetrate the cell wall of microorganisms quickly, and the lethal effects are believed to result from disruption of protein and nucleic acid structure and synthesis. Microbicidal Activity. Published reports on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of iodophors demonstrate that iodophors are bactericidal, mycobactericidal, and virucidal but can require prolonged contact times to kill certain fungi and bacterial spores 14, 71-73, 290, 683-686. Three brands of povidone-iodine solution have demonstrated more rapid kill (seconds to minutes) of S. aureus and M. chelonae at a 1:100 dilution than did the stock solution 683. The virucidal activity of 75–150 ppm available iodine was demonstrated against seven viruses 72. Other investigators have questioned the efficacy of iodophors against poliovirus in the presence of organic matter 685and rotavirus SA-11 in distilled or tapwater 290. Manufacturers' data demonstrate that commercial iodophors are not sporicidal, but they are tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and bactericidal at their recommended use-dilution. Uses. Besides their use as an antiseptic, iodophors have been used for disinfecting blood culture bottles and medical equipment, such as hydrotherapy tanks, thermometers, and endoscopes. Antiseptic iodophors are not suitable for use as hard-surface disinfectants because of concentration differences. Iodophors formulated as antiseptics contain less free iodine than do those formulated as disinfectants 376. Iodine or iodine-based antiseptics should not be used on silicone catheters because they can adversely affect the silicone tubing 687. Ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) Overview. Ortho-phthalaldehyde is a high-level disinfectant that received FDA clearance in October 1999. It contains 0.55% 1,2-benzenedicarboxaldehyde (OPA). OPA solution is a clear, pale-blue liquid with a pH of 7.5. (Tables 4 and 5) Mode of Action. Preliminary studies on the mode of action of OPA suggest that both OPA and glutaraldehyde interact with amino acids, proteins, and microorganisms. However, OPA is a less potent cross-linking agent. This is compensated for by the lipophilic aromatic nature of OPA that is likely to assist its uptake through the outer layers of mycobacteria and gram-negative bacteria 688-690. OPA appears to kill spores by blocking the spore germination process 691. Microbicidal Activity. Studies have demonstrated excellent microbicidal activity in vitro 69, 100, 271, 400, 692-703. For example, OPA has superior mycobactericidal activity (5-log10 reduction in 5 minutes) to glutaraldehyde.

For example, OPA has superior mycobactericidal activity (5-log10 reduction in 5 minutes) to glutaraldehyde. The mean times required to produce a 6-log10 reduction for M. bovis using 0.21% OPA was 6 minutes, compared with 32 minutes using 1.5% glutaraldehyde 693. OPA showed good activity against the mycobacteria tested, including the glutaraldehyde-resistant strains, but 0.5% OPA was not sporicidal with 270 minutes of exposure. Increasing the pH from its unadjusted level (about 6.5) to pH 8 Last update: June 2024 49 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) improved the sporicidal activity of OPA 694. The level of biocidal activity was directly related to the temperature. A greater than 5-log10 reduction of B. atrophaeus spores was observed in 3 hours at 35oC, than in 24 hours at 20oC. Also, with an exposure time ≤5 minutes, biocidal activity decreased with increasing serum concentration. However, efficacy did not differ when the exposure time was ≥10 minutes 697. In addition, OPA is effective (>5-log10 reduction) against a wide range of microorganisms, including glutaraldehyde-resistant mycobacteria and B. atrophaeus spores 694. The influence of laboratory adaptation of test strains, such as P. aeruginosa, to 0.55% OPA has been evaluated. Resistant and multiresistant strains increased substantially in susceptibility to OPA after laboratory adaptation (log10 reduction factors increased by 0.54 and 0.91 for resistant and multiresistant strains, respectively) 704. Other studies have found naturally occurring cells of P. aeurginosa were more resistant to a variety of disinfectants than were subcultured cells 705. Uses. OPA has several potential advantages over glutaraldehyde. It has excellent stability over a wide pH range (pH 3–9), is not a known irritant to the eyes and nasal passages 706, does not require exposure monitoring, has a barely perceptible odor, and requires no activation. OPA, like glutaraldehyde, has excellent material compatibility. A potential disadvantage of OPA is that it stains proteins gray (including unprotected skin) and thus must be handled with caution 69. However, skin staining would indicate improper handling that requires additional training and/or personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, eye and mouth protection, and fluid-resistant gowns). OPA residues remaining on inadequately water-rinsed transesophageal echo probes can stain the patient’s mouth 707. Meticulous cleaning, using the correct OPA exposure time (e.g., 12 minutes) and copious rinsing of the probe with water should eliminate this problem. The results of one study provided a basis for a recommendation that rinsing of instruments disinfected with OPA will require at least 250 mL of water per channel to reduce the chemical residue to a level that will not compromise patient or staff safety (<1 ppm) 708. Personal protective equipment should be worn when contaminated instruments, equipment, and chemicals are handled 400.

Personal protective equipment should be worn when contaminated instruments, equipment, and chemicals are handled 400. In addition, equipment must be thoroughly rinsed to prevent discoloration of a patient’s skin or mucous membrane. In April 2004, the manufacturer of OPA disseminated information to users about patients who reportedly experienced an anaphylaxis-like reaction after cystoscopy where the scope had been reprocessed using OPA. Of approximately 1 million urologic procedures performed using instruments reprocessed using OPA, 24 cases (17 cases in the United States, six in Japan, one in the United Kingdom) of anaphylaxis-like reactions have been reported after repeated cystoscopy (typically after four to nine treatments). Preventive measures include removal of OPA residues by thorough rinsing and not using OPA for reprocessing urologic instrumentation used to treat patients with a history of bladder cancer (Nevine Erian, personal communication, June 4, 2004; Product Notification, Advanced Sterilization Products, April 23, 2004) 709. A few OPA clinical studies are available. In a clinical-use study, OPA exposure of 100 endoscopes for 5 minutes resulted in a >5-log10 reduction in bacterial load. Furthermore, OPA was effective over a 14-day use cycle 100. Manufacturer data show that OPA will last longer in an automatic endoscope reprocessor before reaching its MEC limit (MEC after 82 cycles) than will glutaraldehyde (MEC after 40 cycles) 400. High-pressure liquid chromatography confirmed that OPA levels are maintained above 0.3% for at least 50 cycles 706, 710. OPA must be disposed in accordance with local and state regulations. If OPA disposal through the sanitary sewer system is restricted, glycine (25 grams/gallon) can be used to neutralize the OPA and make it safe for disposal. The high-level disinfectant label claims for OPA solution at 20oC vary worldwide (e.g., 5 minutes in Europe, Asia, and Latin America; 10 minutes in Canada and Australia; and 12 minutes in the United States). These label claims differ worldwide because of differences in the test methodology and requirements for licensure. In an automated endoscope reprocessor with an FDA-cleared capability to maintain solution temperatures at 25°C, the contact time for OPA is 5 minutes. Last update: June 2024 50 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Peracetic Acid Overview. Peracetic, or peroxyacetic, acid is characterized by rapid action against all microorganisms. Special advantages of peracetic acid are that it lacks harmful decomposition products (i.e., acetic acid, water, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide), enhances removal of organic material 711, and leaves no residue.

It remains effective in the presence of organic matter and is sporicidal even at low temperatures (Tables 4 and 5). Peracetic acid can corrode copper, brass, bronze, plain steel, and galvanized iron but these effects can be reduced by additives and pH modifications. It is considered unstable, particularly when diluted; for example, a 1% solution loses half its strength through hydrolysis in 6 days, whereas 40% peracetic acid loses 1%–2% of its active ingredients per month 654. Mode of Action. Little is known about the mechanism of action of peracetic acid, but it is believed to function similarly to other oxidizing agents—that is, it denatures proteins, disrupts the cell wall permeability, and oxidizes sulfhydryl and sulfur bonds in proteins, enzymes, and other metabolites 654. Microbicidal Activity. Peracetic acid will inactivate gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and yeasts in ≤5 minutes at <100 ppm. In the presence of organic matter, 200–500 ppm is required. For viruses, the dosage range is wide (12–2250 ppm), with poliovirus inactivated in yeast extract in 15 minutes with 1,500–2,250 ppm. In one study, 3.5% peracetic acid was ineffective against HAV after 1- minute exposure using a carrier test 58. Peracetic acid (0.26%) was effective (log10 reduction factor >5) against all test strains of mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis, M. avium-intracellulare, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum) within 20–30 minutes in the presence or absence of an organic load 607, 712. With bacterial spores, 500–10,000 ppm (0.05%–1%) inactivates spores in 15 seconds to 30 minutes using a spore suspension test 654, 659, 713-715. Uses. An automated machine using peracetic acid to chemically sterilize medical (e.g., endoscopes, arthroscopes), surgical, and dental instruments is used in the United States716-718. As previously noted, dental handpieces should be steam sterilized. The sterilant, 35% peracetic acid, is diluted to 0.2% with filtered water at 50oC. Simulated-use trials have demonstrated excellent microbicidal activity 111, 718-722, and three clinical trials have demonstrated both excellent microbial killing and no clinical failures leading to infection90, 723, 724. The high efficacy of the system was demonstrated in a comparison of the efficacies of the system with that of ethylene oxide. Only the peracetic acid system completely killed 6 log10 of M. chelonae, E. faecalis, and B. atrophaeus spores with both an organic and inorganic challenge722. An investigation that compared the costs, performance, and maintenance of urologic endoscopic equipment processed by high-level disinfection (with glutaraldehyde) with those of the peracetic acid system reported no clinical differences between the two systems. However, the use of this system led to higher costs than the high-level disinfection, including costs for processing ($6.11 vs. $0.45 per cycle), purchasing and training ($24,845 vs. $16), installation ($5,800 vs. $0), and endoscope repairs ($6,037 vs. $445) 90.

Furthermore, three clusters of infection using the peracetic acid automated endoscope reprocessor were linked to inadequately processed bronchoscopes when inappropriate channel connectors were used with the system 725. These clusters highlight the importance of training, proper model-specific endoscope connector systems, and quality-control procedures to ensure compliance with endoscope manufacturer recommendations and professional organization guidelines. An alternative high- level disinfectant available in the United Kingdom contains 0.35% peracetic acid. Although this product is rapidly effective against a broad range of microorganisms 466, 726, 727, it tarnishes the metal of endoscopes and is unstable, resulting in only a 24-hour use life 727. Peracetic Acid and Hydrogen Peroxide Overview. Two chemical sterilants are available that contain peracetic acid plus hydrogen peroxide (i.e., 0.08% peracetic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen peroxide [no longer marketed]; and 0.23% peracetic acid plus 7.35% hydrogen peroxide (Tables 4 and 5).

The 0.08% peracetic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen peroxide product effectively inactivated glutaraldehyde-resistant mycobacteria729. Uses. The combination of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide has been used for disinfecting hemodialyzers 730. The percentage of dialysis centers using a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectant for reprocessing dialyzers increased from 5% in 1983 to 56% in 1997249. Olympus America does not endorse use of 0.08% peracetic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen peroxide (Olympus America, personal communication, April 15, 1998) on any Olympus endoscope because of cosmetic and functional damage and will not assume liability for chemical damage resulting from use of this product. This product is not currently available. FDA has cleared a newer chemical sterilant with 0.23% peracetic acid and 7.35% hydrogen peroxide (Tables 4 and 5). After testing the 7.35% hydrogen peroxide and 0.23% peracetic acid product, Olympus America concluded it was not compatible with the company’s flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes; this conclusion was based on immersion studies where the test insertion tubes had failed because of swelling and loosening of the black polymer layer of the tube (Olympus America, personal communication, September 13, 2000). Phenolics Overview. Phenol has occupied a prominent place in the field of hospital disinfection since its initial use as a germicide by Lister in his pioneering work on antiseptic surgery.

Phenolics Overview. Phenol has occupied a prominent place in the field of hospital disinfection since its initial use as a germicide by Lister in his pioneering work on antiseptic surgery. In the past 30 years, however, work has concentrated on the numerous phenol derivatives or phenolics and their antimicrobial properties. Phenol derivatives originate when a functional group (e.g., alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, halogen) replaces one of the hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring. Two phenol derivatives commonly found as constituents of hospital disinfectants are ortho-phenylphenol and ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenol. The antimicrobial properties of these compounds and many other phenol derivatives are much improved over those of the parent chemical. Phenolics are absorbed by porous materials, and the residual disinfectant can irritate tissue. In 1970, depigmentation of the skin was reported to be caused by phenolic germicidal detergents containing para-tertiary butylphenol and para-tertiary amylphenol 731. Mode of Action. In high concentrations, phenol acts as a gross protoplasmic poison, penetrating and disrupting the cell wall and precipitating the cell proteins. Low concentrations of phenol and higher molecular-weight phenol derivatives cause bacterial death by inactivation of essential enzyme systems and leakage of essential metabolites from the cell wall 732. Microbicidal Activity. Published reports on the antimicrobial efficacy of commonly used phenolics showed they were bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and tuberculocidal 14, 61, 71, 73, 227, 416, 573, 732-738. One study demonstrated little or no virucidal effect of a phenolic against coxsackie B4, echovirus 11, and poliovirus 1 736. Similarly, 12% ortho-phenylphenol failed to inactivate any of the three hydrophilic viruses after a 10-minute exposure time, although 5% phenol was lethal for these viruses 72. A 0.5% dilution of a phenolic (2.8% ortho-phenylphenol and 2.7% ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenol) inactivated HIV 227 and a 2% solution of a phenolic (15% ortho-phenylphenol and 6.3% para-tertiary-amylphenol) inactivated all but one of 11 fungi tested 71. Manufacturers’ data using the standardized AOAC methods demonstrate that commercial phenolics are not sporicidal but are tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and bactericidal at their recommended use- dilution. Attempts to substantiate the bactericidal label claims of phenolics using the AOAC Use-Dilution Method occasionally have failed 416, 737. However, results from these same studies have varied dramatically among laboratories testing identical products. Uses. Many phenolic germicides are EPA-registered as disinfectants for use on environmental surfaces (e.g., bedside tables, bedrails, and laboratory surfaces) and noncritical medical devices. Phenolics are not FDA-cleared as high-level disinfectants for use with semicritical items but could be used to preclean Last update: June 2024 52 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) or decontaminate critical and semicritical devices before terminal sterilization or high-level disinfection.

In addition, bilirubin levels were reported to increase in phenolic-exposed infants, compared with nonphenolic-exposed infants, when the phenolic was prepared according to the manufacturers' recommended dilution 740. If phenolics are used to clean nursery floors, they must be diluted as recommended on the product label. Phenolics (and other disinfectants) should not be used to clean infant bassinets and incubators while occupied. If phenolics are used to terminally clean infant bassinets and incubators, the surfaces should be rinsed thoroughly with water and dried before reuse of infant bassinets and incubators 17. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds Overview. The quaternary ammonium compounds are widely used as disinfectants. Health-care– associated infections have been reported from contaminated quaternary ammonium compounds used to disinfect patient-care supplies or equipment, such as cystoscopes or cardiac catheters 741, 742. The quaternaries are good cleaning agents, but high water hardness 743 and materials such as cotton and gauze pads can make them less microbicidal because of insoluble precipitates or cotton and gauze pads absorb the active ingredients, respectively. One study showed a significant decline (~40%–50% lower at 1 hour) in the concentration of quaternaries released when cotton rags or cellulose-based wipers were used in the open-bucket system, compared with the nonwoven spunlace wipers in the closed-bucket system 744 As with several other disinfectants (e.g., phenolics, iodophors) gram-negative bacteria can survive or grow in them 404. Chemically, the quaternaries are organically substituted ammonium compounds in which the nitrogen atom has a valence of 5, four of the substituent radicals (R1-R4) are alkyl or heterocyclic radicals of a given size or chain length, and the fifth (X-) is a halide, sulfate, or similar radical 745. Each compound exhibits its own antimicrobial characteristics, hence the search for one compound with outstanding antimicrobial properties. Some of the chemical names of quaternary ammonium compounds used in healthcare are alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, alkyl didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, and dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride. The newer quaternary ammonium compounds (i.e., fourth generation), referred to as twin-chain or dialkyl quaternaries (e.g. didecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide and dioctyl dimethyl ammonium bromide), purportedly remain active in hard water and are tolerant of anionic residues 746. A few case reports have documented occupational asthma as a result of exposure to benzalkonium chloride 747. Mode of Action. The bactericidal action of the quaternaries has been attributed to the inactivation of energy-producing enzymes, denaturation of essential cell proteins, and disruption of the cell membrane746. Evidence exists that supports these and other possibilities 745 748. Microbicidal Activity. Results from manufacturers' data sheets and from published scientific literature indicate that the quaternaries sold as hospital disinfectants are generally fungicidal, bactericidal, and virucidal against lipophilic (enveloped)", "page_start": 53, "page_end": 53, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

Results from manufacturers' data sheets and from published scientific literature indicate that the quaternaries sold as hospital disinfectants are generally fungicidal, bactericidal, and virucidal against lipophilic (enveloped) viruses; they are not sporicidal and generally not tuberculocidal or virucidal against hydrophilic (nonenveloped) viruses14, 54-56, 58, 59, 61, 71, 73, 186, 297, 748, 749. The poor mycobactericidal activities of quaternary ammonium compounds have been demonstrated 55, 73. Quaternary ammonium compounds (as well as 70% isopropyl alcohol, phenolic, and a chlorine-containing wipe [80 ppm]) effectively (>95%) remove and/or inactivate contaminants (i.e., multidrug-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Entercoccus, P. aeruginosa) from computer keyboards with a 5-second application time. No functional damage or cosmetic changes occurred to the computer keyboards after 300 applications of the disinfectants 45. Attempts to reproduce the manufacturers' bactericidal and tuberculocidal claims using the AOAC tests Last update: June 2024 53 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) with a limited number of quaternary ammonium compounds occasionally have failed 73, 416, 737. However, test results have varied extensively among laboratories testing identical products 416, 737. Uses. The quaternaries commonly are used in ordinary environmental sanitation of noncritical surfaces, such as floors, furniture, and walls. EPA-registered quaternary ammonium compounds are appropriate to use for disinfecting medical equipment that contacts intact skin (e.g., blood pressure cuffs). Last update: June 2024 54 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Miscellaneous Inactivating Agents Other Germicides Several compounds have antimicrobial activity but for various reasons have not been incorporated into the armamentarium of health-care disinfectants. These include mercurials, sodium hydroxide, β- propiolactone, chlorhexidine gluconate, cetrimide-chlorhexidine, glycols (triethylene and propylene), and the Tego disinfectants. Two authoritative references examine these agents in detail 16, 412. A peroxygen-containing formulation had marked bactericidal action when used as a 1% weight/volume solution and virucidal activity at 3% 49, but did not have mycobactericidal activity at concentrations of 2.3% and 4% and exposure times ranging from 30 to 120 minutes 750. It also required 20 hours to kill B. atrophaeus spores 751. A powder-based peroxygen compound for disinfecting contaminated spill was strongly and rapidly bactericidal 752. In preliminary studies, nanoemulsions (composed of detergents and lipids in water) showed activity against vegetative bacteria, enveloped viruses and Candida. This product represents a potential agent for use as a topical biocidal agent. 753-755.

Metals as Microbicides Comprehensive reviews of antisepsis 759, disinfection421, and anti-infective chemotherapy 760 barely mention the antimicrobial activity of heavy metals761, 762. Nevertheless, the anti-infective activity of some heavy metals has been known since antiquity. Heavy metals such as silver have been used for prophylaxis of conjunctivitis of the newborn, topical therapy for burn wounds, and bonding to indwelling catheters, and the use of heavy metals as antiseptics or disinfectants is again being explored 763. Inactivation of bacteria on stainless steel surfaces by zeolite ceramic coatings containing silver and zinc ions has also been demonstrated 764, 765. Metals such as silver, iron, and copper could be used for environmental control, disinfection of water, or reusable medical devices or incorporated into medical devices (e.g., intravascular catheters) 400, 761-763, 766-770. A comparative evaluation of six disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity demonstrated that only the silver disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa 763. Preliminary data suggest metals are effective against a wide variety of microorganisms. Clinical uses of other heavy metals include copper-8-quinolinolate as a fungicide against Aspergillus, copper-silver ionization for Legionella disinfection 771-774, organic mercurials as an antiseptic (e.g., mercurochrome) and preservative/disinfectant (e.g., thimerosal [currently being removed from vaccines]) in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics 762. Ultraviolet Radiation (UV) The wavelength of UV radiation ranges from 328 nm to 210 nm (3280 A to 2100 A). Its maximum bactericidal effect occurs at 240–280 nm. Mercury vapor lamps emit more than 90% of their radiation at 253.7 nm, which is near the maximum microbicidal activity 775. Inactivation of microorganisms results from destruction of nucleic acid through induction of thymine dimers. UV radiation has been employed in the disinfection of drinking water 776, air 775, titanium implants 777, and contact lenses778. Bacteria and viruses are more easily killed by UV light than are bacterial spores 775. UV radiation has several potential applications, but unfortunately its germicidal effectiveness and use is influenced by organic matter; wavelength; type of suspension; temperature; type of microorganism; and UV intensity, which is affected Last update: June 2024 55 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) by distance and dirty tubes779. The application of UV radiation in the health-care environment (i.e., operating rooms, isolation rooms, and biologic safety cabinets) is limited to destruction of airborne organisms or inactivation of microorganisms on surfaces. The effect of UV radiation on postoperative wound infections was investigated in a double-blind, randomized study in five university medical centers. After following 14,854 patients over a 2-year period, the investigators reported the overall wound infection rate was unaffected by UV radiation, although postoperative infection in the “refined clean” surgical procedures decreased significantly (3.8%–2.9%) 780.

No data support the use of UV lamps in isolation rooms, and this practice has caused at least one epidemic of UV-induced skin erythema and keratoconjunctivitis in hospital patients and visitors 781. Pasteurization Pasteurization is not a sterilization process; its purpose is to destroy all pathogenic microorganisms. However, pasteurization does not destroy bacterial spores. The time-temperature relation for hot-water pasteurization is generally ~70°C (158°F) for 30 minutes. The water temperature and time should be monitored as part of a quality-assurance program 782. Pasteurization of respiratory therapy 783, 784 and anesthesia equipment 785 is a recognized alternative to chemical disinfection. The efficacy of this process has been tested using an inoculum that the authors believed might simulate contamination by an infected patient. Use of a large inoculum (107) of P. aeruginosa or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in sets of respiratory tubing before processing demonstrated that machine-assisted chemical processing was more efficient than machine-assisted pasteurization with a disinfection failure rate of 6% and 83%, respectively 783.Other investigators found hot water disinfection to be effective (inactivation factor >5 log10) against multiple bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria, for disinfecting reusable anesthesia or respiratory therapy equipment 784-786. Flushing- and Washer-Disinfectors Flushing- and washer-disinfectors are automated and closed equipment that clean and disinfect objects from bedpans and washbowls to surgical instruments and anesthesia tubes. Items such as bedpans and urinals can be cleaned and disinfected in flushing-disinfectors. They have a short cycle of a few minutes. They clean by flushing with warm water, possibly with a detergent, and then disinfect by flushing the items with hot water or with steam. Because this machine empties, cleans, and disinfects, manual cleaning is eliminated, fewer disposable items are needed, and fewer chemical germicides are used. A microbiologic evaluation of one washer/disinfector demonstrated complete inactivation of suspensions of E. faecalis or poliovirus 787. Other studies have shown that strains of Enterococcus faecium can survive the British Standard for heat disinfection of bedpans (80oC for 1 minute). The significance of this finding with reference to the potential for enterococci to survive and disseminate in the health-care environment is debatable 788-790. These machines are available and used in many European countries. Surgical instruments and anesthesia equipment are more difficult to clean. They are run in washer- disinfectors on a longer cycle of approximately 20–30 minutes with a detergent. These machines also disinfect by hot water at approximately 90°C 791.

Last update: June 2024 56 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) The Regulatory Framework for Disinfectants and Sterilants Before using the guidance provided in this document, health-care workers should be aware of the federal laws and regulations that govern the sale, distribution, and use of disinfectants and sterilants. In particular, health-care workers need to know what requirements pertain to them when they apply these products. Finally, they should understand the relative roles of EPA, FDA, and CDC so the context for the guidance provided in this document is clear. EPA and FDA In the United States, chemical germicides formulated as sanitizers, disinfectants, or sterilants are regulated in interstate commerce by the Antimicrobials Division, Office of Pesticides Program, EPA, under the authority of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1947, as amended 792. Under FIFRA, any substance or mixture of substances intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate any pest (including microorganisms but excluding those in or on living humans or animals) must be registered before sale or distribution. To obtain a registration, a manufacturer must submit specific data about the safety and effectiveness of each product. For example, EPA requires manufacturers of sanitizers, disinfectants, or chemical sterilants to test formulations by using accepted methods for microbiocidal activity, stability, and toxicity to animals and humans. The manufacturers submit these data to EPA along with proposed labeling. If EPA concludes the product can be used without causing “unreasonable adverse effects,” then the product and its labeling are registered, and the manufacturer can sell and distribute the product in the United States. FIFRA also requires users of products to follow explicitly the labeling directions on each product. The following standard statement appears on all labels under the “Directions for Use” heading: “It is a violation of federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.” This statement means a health-care worker must follow the safety precautions and use directions on the labeling of each registered product. Failure to follow the specified use-dilution, contact time, method of application, or any other condition of use is considered a misuse of the product and potentially subject to enforcement action under FIFRA. In general, EPA regulates disinfectants and sterilants used on environmental surfaces, and not those used on critical or semicritical medical devices; the latter are regulated by FDA. In June 1993, FDA and EPA issued a “Memorandum of Understanding” that divided responsibility for review and surveillance of chemical germicides between the two agencies. Under the agreement, FDA regulates liquid chemical sterilants used on critical and semicritical devices, and EPA regulates disinfectants used on noncritical surfaces and gaseous sterilants 793.

Under the agreement, FDA regulates liquid chemical sterilants used on critical and semicritical devices, and EPA regulates disinfectants used on noncritical surfaces and gaseous sterilants 793. In 1996, Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). This act amended FIFRA in regard to several types of products regulated by both EPA and FDA. One provision of FQPA removed regulation of liquid chemical sterilants used on critical and semicritical medical devices from EPA’s jurisdiction, and it now rests solely with FDA 792, 794. EPA continues to register nonmedical chemical sterilants. FDA and EPA have considered the impact of FQPA, and in January 2000, FDA published its final guidance document on product submissions and labeling. Antiseptics are considered antimicrobial drugs used on living tissue and thus are regulated by FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. FDA regulates liquid chemical sterilants and high-level disinfectants intended to process critical and semicritical devices. FDA has published recommendations on the types of test methods that manufacturers should submit to FDA for 510[k] clearance for such agents. CDC At CDC, the mission of the Coordinating Center for Infections Diseases is to guide the public on how to prevent and respond to infectious diseases in both health-care settings and at home. With respect to disinfectants and sterilants, part of CDC’s role is to inform the public (in this case healthcare personnel) of current scientific evidence pertaining to these products, to comment about their safety and efficacy, and to recommend which chemicals might be most appropriate or effective for specific microorganisms and settings. Last update: June 2024 57 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Test Methods The methods EPA has used for registration are standardized by the AOAC International; however, a survey of scientific literature reveals a number of problems with these tests that were reported during 1987–1990 58, 76, 80, 428, 736, 737, 795-800 that cause them to be neither accurate nor reproducible 416, 737. As part of their regulatory authority, EPA and FDA support development and validation of methods for assessing disinfection claims 801-803. For example, EPA has supported the work of Dr. Syed Sattar and coworkers who have developed a two-tier quantitative carrier test to assess sporicidal, mycobactericidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and protozoacidal activity of chemical germicides 701, 803. EPA is accepting label claims against hepatitis B virus (HBV) using a surrogate organism, the duck HBV, to quantify disinfectant activity 124, 804. EPA also is accepting labeling claims against hepatitis C virus using the bovine viral diarrhea virus as a surrogate. For nearly 30 years, EPA also performed intramural preregistration and postregistration efficacy testing of some chemical disinfectants in its own laboratories. In 1982, this was stopped, reportedly for budgetary reasons. At that", "page_start": 57, "page_end": 58, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

For nearly 30 years, EPA also performed intramural preregistration and postregistration efficacy testing of some chemical disinfectants in its own laboratories. In 1982, this was stopped, reportedly for budgetary reasons. At that time, manufacturers did not need to have microbiologic activity claims verified by EPA or an independent testing laboratory when registering a disinfectant or chemical sterilant 805. This occurred when the frequency of contaminated germicides and infections secondary to their use had increased 404. Investigations demonstrating that interlaboratory reproducibility of test results was poor and manufacturers' label claims were not verifiable 416, 737 and symposia sponsored by the American Society for Microbiology 800 heightened awareness of these problems and reconfirmed the need to improve the AOAC methods and reinstate a microbiologic activity verification program. A General Accounting Office report entitled Disinfectants: EPA Lacks Assurance They Work 806 seemed to provide the necessary impetus for EPA to initiate corrective measures, including cooperative agreements to improve the AOAC methods and independent verification testing for all products labeled as sporicidal and disinfectants labeled as tuberculocidal. For example, of 26 sterilant products tested by EPA, 15 were canceled because of product failure. A list of products registered with EPA and labeled for use as sterilants or tuberculocides or against HIV and/or HBV is available through EPA’s website at [This link is no longer active: http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.htm. The current version of this document may differ from original version: Selected EPA-registered Disinfectants (https://www.epa.gov/pesticide- registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants).]. Organizations (e.g., Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) are working to standardize requirements for germicide testing and registration. Neutralization of Germicides One of the difficulties associated with evaluating the bactericidal activity of disinfectants is prevention of bacteriostasis from disinfectant residues carried over into the subculture media. Likewise, small amounts of disinfectants on environmental surfaces can make an accurate bacterial count difficult to get when sampling of the health-care environment as part of an epidemiologic or research investigation. One way these problems may be overcome is by employing neutralizers that inactivate residual disinfectants 807-809. Two commonly used neutralizing media for chemical disinfectants are Letheen Media and D/E Neutralizing Media. The former contains lecithin to neutralize quaternaries and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80)to neutralize phenolics, hexachlorophene, formalin, and, with lecithin, ethanol. The D/E Neutralizing media will neutralize a broad spectrum of antiseptic and disinfectant chemicals, including quaternary ammonium compounds, phenols, iodine and chlorine compounds, mercurials, formaldehyde, and glutaraldehyde 810. A review of neutralizers used in germicide testing has been published808.

Last update: June 2024 58 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Sterilization Most medical and surgical devices used in healthcare facilities are made of materials that are heat stable and therefore undergo heat, primarily steam, sterilization. However, since 1950, there has been an increase in medical devices and instruments made of materials (e.g., plastics) that require low- temperature sterilization. Ethylene oxide gas has been used since the 1950s for heat- and moisture- sensitive medical devices. Within the past 15 years, a number of new, low-temperature sterilization systems (e.g., hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, peracetic acid immersion, ozone) have been developed and are being used to sterilize medical devices. This section reviews sterilization technologies used in healthcare and makes recommendations for their optimum performance in the processing of medical devices 1, 18, 811-820. Sterilization destroys all microorganisms on the surface of an article or in a fluid to prevent disease transmission associated with the use of that item. While the use of inadequately sterilized critical items represents a high risk of transmitting pathogens, documented transmission of pathogens associated with an inadequately sterilized critical item is exceedingly rare 821, 822. This is likely due to the wide margin of safety associated with the sterilization processes used in healthcare facilities. The concept of what constitutes \"sterile\" is measured as a probability of sterility for each item to be sterilized. This probability is commonly referred to as the sterility assurance level (SAL) of the product and is defined as the probability of a single viable microorganism occurring on a product after sterilization. SAL is normally expressed a 10-n. For example, if the probability of a spore surviving were one in one million, the SAL would be 10-6 823, 824.In short, a SAL is an estimate of lethality of the entire sterilization process and is a conservative calculation. Dual SALs (e.g., 10-3 SAL for blood culture tubes, drainage bags; 10-6 SAL for scalpels, implants) have been used in the United States for many years and the choice of a 10-6 SAL was strictly arbitrary and not associated with any adverse outcomes (e.g., patient infections) 823. Medical devices that have contact with sterile body tissues or fluids are considered critical items. These items should be sterile when used because any microbial contamination could result in disease transmission. Such items include surgical instruments, biopsy forceps, and implanted medical devices. If these items are heat resistant, the recommended sterilization process is steam sterilization, because it has the largest margin of safety due to its reliability, consistency, and lethality. However, reprocessing heat- and moisture-sensitive items requires use of a low-temperature sterilization technology (e.g., ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, peracetic acid) 825.

A summary of the advantages and disadvantages for commonly used sterilization technologies is presented in Table 6. Steam Sterilization Overview. Of all the methods available for sterilization, moist heat in the form of saturated steam under pressure is the most widely used and the most dependable. Steam sterilization is nontoxic, inexpensive 826, rapidly microbicidal, sporicidal, and rapidly heats and penetrates fabrics (Table 6) 827. Like all sterilization processes, steam sterilization has some deleterious effects on some materials, including corrosion and combustion of lubricants associated with dental handpieces212; reduction in ability to transmit light associated with laryngoscopes828; and increased hardening time (5.6 fold) with plaster- cast 829. The basic principle of steam sterilization, as accomplished in an autoclave, is to expose each item to direct steam contact at the required temperature and pressure for the specified time. Thus, there are four parameters of steam sterilization: steam, pressure, temperature, and time. The ideal steam for sterilization is dry saturated steam and entrained water (dryness fraction ≥97%)813, 819. Pressure serves as a means to obtain the high temperatures necessary to quickly kill microorganisms. Specific temperatures must be obtained to ensure the microbicidal activity. The two common steam-sterilizing temperatures are 121°C (250°F) and 132°C (270°F). These temperatures (and other high temperatures) 830 must be maintained for a minimal time to kill microorganisms. Recognized minimum exposure periods for sterilization of wrapped healthcare supplies are 30 minutes at 121°C (250°F) in a gravity displacement Last update: June 2024 59 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) sterilizer or 4 minutes at 132°C (270°C) in a prevacuum sterilizer (Table 7). At constant temperatures, sterilization times vary depending on the type of item (e.g., metal versus rubber, plastic, items with lumens), whether the item is wrapped or unwrapped, and the sterilizer type. The two basic types of steam sterilizers (autoclaves) are the gravity displacement autoclave and the high-speed prevacuum sterilizer. In the former, steam is admitted at the top or the sides of the sterilizing chamber and, because the steam is lighter than air, forces air out the bottom of the chamber through the drain vent. The gravity displacement autoclaves are primarily used to process laboratory media, water, pharmaceutical products, regulated medical waste, and nonporous articles whose surfaces have direct steam contact. For gravity displacement sterilizers the penetration time into porous items is prolonged because of incomplete air elimination. This point is illustrated with the decontamination of 10 lbs of microbiological waste, which requires at least 45 minutes at 121°C because the entrapped air remaining in a load of waste greatly retards steam permeation and heating efficiency831, 832. The high-speed prevacuum sterilizers are similar", "page_start": 59, "page_end": 60, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

The high-speed prevacuum sterilizers are similar to the gravity displacement sterilizers except they are fitted with a vacuum pump (or ejector) to ensure air removal from the sterilizing chamber and load before the steam is admitted. The advantage of using a vacuum pump is that there is nearly instantaneous steam penetration even into porous loads. The Bowie-Dick test is used to detect air leaks and inadequate air removal and consists of folded 100% cotton surgical towels that are clean and preconditioned. A commercially available Bowie-Dick-type test sheet should be placed in the center of the pack. The test pack should be placed horizontally in the front, bottom section of the sterilizer rack, near the door and over the drain, in an otherwise empty chamber and run at 134°C for 3.5 minutes813, 819. The test is used each day the vacuum-type steam sterilizer is used, before the first processed load. Air that is not removed from the chamber will interfere with steam contact. Smaller disposable test packs (or process challenge devices) have been devised to replace the stack of folded surgical towels for testing the efficacy of the vacuum system in a prevacuum sterilizer. 833 These devices are “designed to simulate product to be sterilized and to constitute a defined challenge to the sterilization process”819, 834. They should be representative of the load and simulate the greatest challenge to the load835. Sterilizer vacuum performance is acceptable if the sheet inside the test pack shows a uniform color change. Entrapped air will cause a spot to appear on the test sheet, due to the inability of the steam to reach the chemical indicator. If the sterilizer fails the Bowie- Dick test, do not use the sterilizer until it is inspected by the sterilizer maintenance personnel and passes the Bowie-Dick test813, 819, 836. Another design in steam sterilization is a steam flush-pressure pulsing process, which removes air rapidly by repeatedly alternating a steam flush and a pressure pulse above atmospheric pressure. Air is rapidly removed from the load as with the prevacuum sterilizer, but air leaks do not affect this process because the steam in the sterilizing chamber is always above atmospheric pressure. Typical sterilization temperatures and times are 132°C to 135°C with 3 to 4 minutes exposure time for porous loads and instruments827, 837.

Steam sterilizers usually are monitored using a printout (or graphically) by measuring temperature, the time at the temperature, and pressure. Typically, chemical indicators are affixed to the outside and incorporated into the pack to monitor the temperature or time and temperature. The effectiveness of steam sterilization is monitored with a biological indicator containing spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus). Positive spore test results are a relatively rare event 838 and can be attributed to operator error, inadequate steam delivery839, or equipment malfunction. Portable (table-top) steam sterilizers are used in outpatient, dental, and rural clinics840. These sterilizers are designed for small instruments, such as hypodermic syringes and needles and dental instruments. The ability of the sterilizer to reach physical parameters necessary to achieve sterilization should be monitored by mechanical, chemical, and biological indicators. Last update: June 2024 60 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Microbicidal Activity. The oldest and most recognized agent for inactivation of microorganisms is heat. D-values (time to reduce the surviving population by 90% or 1 log10) allow a direct comparison of the heat resistance of microorganisms. Because a D-value can be determined at various temperatures, a subscript is used to designate the exposure temperature (i.e., D121C). D121C-values for Geobacillus stearothermophilus used to monitor the steam sterilization process range from 1 to 2 minutes. Heat- resistant nonspore-forming bacteria, yeasts, and fungi have such low D121C values that they cannot be experimentally measured841. Mode of Action. Moist heat destroys microorganisms by the irreversible coagulation and denaturation of enzymes and structural proteins. In support of this fact, it has been found that the presence of moisture significantly affects the coagulation temperature of proteins and the temperature at which microorganisms are destroyed. Uses. Steam sterilization should be used whenever possible on all critical and semicritical items that are heat and moisture resistant (e.g., steam sterilizable respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipment), even when not essential to prevent pathogen transmission. Steam sterilizers also are used in healthcare facilities to decontaminate microbiological waste and sharps containers 831, 832, 842 but additional exposure time is required in the gravity displacement sterilizer for these items. Flash Sterilization Overview. “Flash” steam sterilization was originally defined by Underwood and Perkins as sterilization of an unwrapped object at 132°C for 3 minutes at 27-28 lbs. of pressure in a gravity displacement sterilizer843. Currently, the time required for flash sterilization depends on the type of sterilizer and the type of item (i.e., porous vs non-porous items)(see Table 8). Although the wrapped method of sterilization is preferred for the reasons listed below, correctly performed flash sterilization is an effective process for the sterilization of critical medical devices844, 845.

Although the wrapped method of sterilization is preferred for the reasons listed below, correctly performed flash sterilization is an effective process for the sterilization of critical medical devices844, 845. Flash sterilization is a modification of conventional steam sterilization (either gravity, prevacuum, or steam-flush pressure-pulse) in which the flashed item is placed in an open tray or is placed in a specially designed, covered, rigid container to allow for rapid penetration of steam. Historically, it is not recommended as a routine sterilization method because of the lack of timely biological indicators to monitor performance, absence of protective packaging following sterilization, possibility for contamination of processed items during transportation to the operating rooms, and the sterilization cycle parameters (i.e., time, temperature, pressure) are minimal. To address some of these concerns, many healthcare facilities have done the following: placed equipment for flash sterilization in close proximity to operating rooms to facilitate aseptic delivery to the point of use (usually the sterile field in an ongoing surgical procedure); extended the exposure time to ensure lethality comparable to sterilized wrapped items (e.g., 4 minutes at 132°C)846, 847; used biological indicators that provide results in 1 hour for flash-sterilized items846, 847; and used protective packaging that permits steam penetration812, 817-819, 845, 848. Further, some rigid, reusable sterilization container systems have been designed and validated by the container manufacturer for use with flash cycles. When sterile items are open to air, they will eventually become contaminated. Thus, the longer a sterile item is exposed to air, the greater the number of microorganisms that will settle on it. Sterilization cycle parameters for flash sterilization are shown in Table 8. A few adverse events have been associated with flash sterilization. When evaluating an increased incidence of neurosurgical infections, the investigators noted that surgical instruments were flash sterilized between cases and 2 of 3 craniotomy infections involved plate implants that were flash sterilized849. A report of two patients who received burns during surgery from instruments that had been flash sterilized reinforced the need to develop policies and educate staff to prevent the use of instruments hot enough to cause clinical burns850. Staff should use precautions to prevent burns with potentially hot instruments (e.g., transport tray using heat-protective gloves). Patient burns may be prevented by either air-cooling the instruments or immersion in sterile liquid (e.g., saline).

It also is used when there is insufficient time to sterilize an item by the preferred package method. Flash sterilization should not be used for reasons of convenience, as an alternative to purchasing additional instrument sets, or to save time817. Because of the potential for serious infections, flash sterilization is not recommended for implantable devices (i.e., devices placed into a surgically or naturally formed cavity of the human body); however, flash sterilization may be unavoidable for some devices (e.g., orthopedic screw, plates). If flash sterilization of an implantable device is unavoidable, recordkeeping (i.e., load identification, patient’s name/hospital identifier, and biological indicator result) is essential for epidemiological tracking (e.g., of surgical site infection, tracing results of biological indicators to patients who received the item to document sterility), and for an assessment of the reliability of the sterilization process (e.g., evaluation of biological monitoring records and sterilization maintenance records noting preventive maintenance and repairs with dates). Low-Temperature Sterilization Technologies Ethylene oxide (ETO) has been widely used as a low-temperature sterilant since the 1950s. It has been the most commonly used process for sterilizing temperature- and moisture-sensitive medical devices and supplies in healthcare institutions in the United States. Two types of ETO sterilizers are available, mixed gas and 100% ETO. Until 1995, ethylene oxide sterilizers combined ETO with a chloroflourocarbon (CFC) stabilizing agent, most commonly in a ratio of 12% ETO mixed with 88% CFC (referred to as 12/88 ETO). For several reasons, healthcare personnel have been exploring the use of new low-temperature sterilization technologies825, 851. First, CFCs were phased out in December 1995 under provisions of the Clean Air Act 852. CFCs were classified as a Class I substance under the Clean Air Act because of scientific evidence linking them to destruction of the earth’s ozone layer. Second, some states (e.g., California, New York, Michigan) require the use of ETO abatement technology to reduce the amount of ETO being released into ambient air from 90 to 99.9% depending on the state. Third, OSHA regulates the acceptable vapor levels of ETO (i.e., 1 ppm averaged over 8 hours) due to concerns that ETO exposure represents an occupational hazard318. These constraints have led to the development of alternative technologies for low-temperature sterilization in the healthcare setting. Alternative technologies to ETO with chlorofluorocarbon that are currently available and cleared by the FDA for medical equipment include 100% ETO; ETO with a different stabilizing gas, such as carbon dioxide or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC); immersion in peracetic acid; hydrogen peroxide gas plasma; and ozone.

However, there is no guarantee that these new sterilization technologies will receive FDA clearance for use in healthcare facilities. These new technologies should be compared against the characteristics of an ideal low-temperature (<60°C) sterilant (Table 9). 851 While it is apparent that all technologies will have limitations (Table 9), understanding the limitations imposed by restrictive device designs (e.g., long, narrow lumens) is critical for proper application of new sterilization technology854. For example, the development of increasingly small and complex endoscopes presents a difficult challenge for current sterilization processes. This occurs because microorganisms must be in direct contact with the sterilant for inactivation to occur. Several peer-reviewed scientific publications have data demonstrating concerns about the efficacy of several of the low-temperature sterilization processes (i.e., gas plasma, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, ETO, peracetic acid), particularly when the test organisms are challenged in the presence of serum and salt and a narrow lumen vehicle469, 721, 825, 855, 856. Factors shown to affect the efficacy of sterilization are shown in Table 10. Last update: June 2024 62 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Ethylene Oxide \"Gas\" Sterilization Overview. ETO is a colorless gas that is flammable and explosive. The four essential parameters (operational ranges) are: gas concentration (450 to 1200 mg/l); temperature (37 to 63°C); relative humidity (40 to 80%)(water molecules carry ETO to reactive sites); and exposure time (1 to 6 hours). These influence the effectiveness of ETO sterilization814, 857, 858. Within certain limitations, an increase in gas concentration and temperature may shorten the time necessary for achieving sterilization. The main disadvantages associated with ETO are the lengthy cycle time, the cost, and its potential hazards to patients and staff; the main advantage is that it can sterilize heat- or moisture-sensitive medical equipment without deleterious effects on the material used in the medical devices (Table 6). Acute exposure to ETO may result in irritation (e.g., to skin, eyes, gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts) and central nervous system depression859-862. Chronic inhalation has been linked to the formation of cataracts, cognitive impairment, neurologic dysfunction, and disabling polyneuropathies860, 861, 863-866. Occupational exposure in healthcare facilities has been linked to hematologic changes 867 and an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and various cancers318, 868-870. ETO should be considered a known human carcinogen871. The basic ETO sterilization cycle consists of five stages (i.e., preconditioning and humidification, gas introduction, exposure, evacuation, and air washes) and takes approximately 2 1/2 hrs excluding aeration time. Mechanical aeration for 8 to 12 hours at 50 to 60°C allows desorption of the toxic ETO residual", "page_start": 62, "page_end": 63, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

The basic ETO sterilization cycle consists of five stages (i.e., preconditioning and humidification, gas introduction, exposure, evacuation, and air washes) and takes approximately 2 1/2 hrs excluding aeration time. Mechanical aeration for 8 to 12 hours at 50 to 60°C allows desorption of the toxic ETO residual contained in exposed absorbent materials. Most modern ETO sterilizers combine sterilization and aeration in the same chamber as a continuous process. These ETO models minimize potential ETO exposure during door opening and load transfer to the aerator. Ambient room aeration also will achieve desorption of the toxic ETO but requires 7 days at 20°C. There are no federal regulations for ETO sterilizer emission; however, many states have promulgated emission-control regulations814. The use of ETO evolved when few alternatives existed for sterilizing heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices; however, favorable properties (Table 6) account for its continued widespread use872. Two ETO gas mixtures are available to replace ETO-chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) mixtures for large capacity, tank-supplied sterilizers. The ETO-carbon dioxide (CO2) mixture consists of 8.5% ETO and 91.5% CO2. This mixture is less expensive than ETO-hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), but a disadvantage is the need for pressure vessels rated for steam sterilization, because higher pressures (28- psi gauge) are required. The other mixture, which is a drop-in CFC replacement, is ETO mixed with HCFC. HCFCs are approximately 50-fold less damaging to the earth’s ozone layer than are CFCs. The EPA will begin regulation of HCFC in the year 2015 and will terminate production in the year 2030. Two companies provide ETO-HCFC mixtures as drop-in replacement for CFC-12; one mixture consists of 8.6% ETO and 91.4% HCFC, and the other mixture is composed of 10% ETO and 90% HCFC872. An alternative to the pressurized mixed gas ETO systems is 100% ETO. The 100% ETO sterilizers using unit-dose cartridges eliminate the need for external tanks. ETO is absorbed by many materials. For this reason, following sterilization the item must undergo aeration to remove residual ETO. Guidelines have been promulgated regarding allowable ETO limits for devices that depend on how the device is used, how often, and how long in order to pose a minimal risk to patients in normal product use814. ETO toxicity has been established in a variety of animals. Exposure to ETO can cause eye pain, sore throat, difficulty breathing and blurred vision. Exposure can also cause dizziness, nausea, headache, convulsions, blisters and vomiting and coughing873. In a variety of in vitro and animal studies, ETO has been demonstrated to be carcinogenic. ETO has been linked to spontaneous abortion, genetic damage, nerve damage, peripheral paralysis, muscle weakness, and impaired thinking and memory873.

Residual ETO in capillary flow dialysis membranes has been shown to be neurotoxic in vitro875. OSHA has established a PEL of 1 ppm airborne ETO in the workplace, expressed as a TWA for an 8-hour work shift in a 40-hour work week. The “action level” for Last update: June 2024 63 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) ETO is 0.5 ppm, expressed as an 8-hour TWA, and the short-term excursion limit is 5 ppm, expressed as a 15-minute TWA814. For details of the requirements in OSHA’s ETO standard for occupational exposures, see Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1910.1047873. Several personnel monitoring methods (e.g., charcoal tubes and passive sampling devices) are in use814. OSHA has established a PEL of 5 ppm for ethylene chlorohydrin (a toxic by-product of ETO) in the workplace876. Additional information regarding use of ETO in health care facilities is available from NIOSH. Mode of Action. The microbicidal activity of ETO is considered to be the result of alkylation of protein, DNA, and RNA. Alkylation, or the replacement of a hydrogen atom with an alkyl group, within cells prevents normal cellular metabolism and replication877. Microbicidal Activity. The excellent microbicidal activity of ETO has been demonstrated in several studies 469, 721, 722, 856, 878, 879 and summarized in published reports877. ETO inactivates all microorganisms although bacterial spores (especially B. atrophaeus) are more resistant than other microorganisms. For this reason B. atrophaeus is the recommended biological indicator. Like all sterilization processes, the effectiveness of ETO sterilization can be altered by lumen length, lumen diameter, inorganic salts, and organic materials469, 721, 722, 855, 856, 879. For example, although ETO is not used commonly for reprocessing endoscopes28, several studies have shown failure of ETO in inactivating contaminating spores in endoscope channels 855or lumen test units 469, 721, 879 and residual ETO levels averaging 66.2 ppm even after the standard degassing time456. Failure of ETO also has been observed when dental handpieces were contaminated with Streptococcus mutans and exposed to ETO880. It is recommended that dental handpieces be steam sterilized. Uses. ETO is used in healthcare facilities to sterilize critical items (and sometimes semicritical items) that are moisture or heat sensitive and cannot be sterilized by steam sterilization.

Gas plasmas have been referred to as the fourth state of matter (i.e., liquids, solids, gases, and gas plasmas). Gas plasmas are generated in an enclosed chamber under deep vacuum using radio frequency or microwave energy to excite the gas molecules and produce charged particles, many of which are in the form of free radicals. A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and is a highly reactive species. The proposed mechanism of action of this device is the production of free radicals within a plasma field that are capable of interacting with essential cell components (e.g., enzymes, nucleic acids) and thereby disrupt the metabolism of microorganisms. The type of seed gas used and the depth of the vacuum are two important variables that can determine the effectiveness of this process. In the late 1980s the first hydrogen peroxide gas plasma system for sterilization of medical and surgical devices was field-tested. According to the manufacturer, the sterilization chamber is evacuated and hydrogen peroxide solution is injected from a cassette and is vaporized in the sterilization chamber to a concentration of 6 mg/l. The hydrogen peroxide vapor diffuses through the chamber (50 minutes), exposes all surfaces of the load to the sterilant, and initiates the inactivation of microorganisms. An electrical field created by a radio frequency is applied to the chamber to create a gas plasma. Microbicidal free radicals (e.g., hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl) are generated in the plasma. The excess gas is removed and in the final stage (i.e., vent) of the process the sterilization chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure by introduction of high-efficiency filtered air. The by-products of the cycle (e.g., water vapor, oxygen) are nontoxic and eliminate the need for aeration. Thus, the sterilized materials can be handled safely, either for immediate use or storage. The process operates in the range of 37-44°C and has a cycle time of 75 minutes. If any moisture is present on the objects the vacuum will not be achieved and the cycle aborts856, 881-883.

The biological indicator used with this system is Bacillus atrophaeus spores851. The newest version of the unit, which employs a new vaporization system that removes most of the water from the hydrogen peroxide, has a cycle time from 28-38 minutes (see manufacturer’s literature for device dimension restrictions). Penetration of hydrogen peroxide vapor into long or narrow lumens has been addressed outside the United States by the use of a diffusion enhancer. This is a small, breakable glass ampoule of concentrated hydrogen peroxide (50%) with an elastic connector that is inserted into the device lumen and crushed immediately before sterilization470, 885. The diffusion enhancer has been shown to sterilize bronchoscopes contaminated with Mycobacteria tuberculosis886. At the present time, the diffusion enhancer is not FDA cleared. Another gas plasma system, which differs from the above in several important ways, including the use of peracetic acid-acetic acid-hydrogen peroxide vapor, was removed from the marketplace because of reports of corneal destruction to patients when ophthalmic surgery instruments had been processed in the sterilizer887, 888. In this investigation, exposure of potentially wet ophthalmologic surgical instruments with small bores and brass components to the plasma gas led to degradation of the brass to copper and zinc888, 889. The experimenters showed that when rabbit eyes were exposed to the rinsates of the gas plasma-sterilized instruments, corneal decompensation was documented. This toxicity is highly unlikely with the hydrogen peroxide gas plasma process since a toxic, soluble form of copper would not form (LA Feldman, written communication, April 1998). Mode of Action. This process inactivates microorganisms primarily by the combined use of hydrogen peroxide gas and the generation of free radicals (hydroxyl and hydroproxyl free radicals) during the plasma phase of the cycle. Microbicidal Activity. This process has the ability to inactivate a broad range of microorganisms, including resistant bacterial spores. Studies have been conducted against vegetative bacteria (including mycobacteria), yeasts, fungi, viruses, and bacterial spores469, 721, 856, 881-883, 890-893.

Peracetic acid is a highly biocidal oxidizer that maintains its efficacy in the presence of organic soil. Peracetic acid removes surface contaminants (primarily protein) on endoscopic tubing711, 717. An automated machine using peracetic acid to sterilize medical, surgical, and dental instruments chemically (e.g., endoscopes, arthroscopes) was introduced in 1988. This microprocessor-controlled, low- temperature sterilization method is commonly used in the United States107. The sterilant, 35% peracetic acid, and an anticorrosive agent are supplied in a single-dose container. The container is punctured at the time of use, immediately prior to closing the lid and initiating the cycle. The concentrated peracetic acid is diluted to 0.2% with filtered water (0.2 μm) at a temperature of approximately 50°C. The diluted peracetic Last update: June 2024 65 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) acid is circulated within the chamber of the machine and pumped through the channels of the endoscope for 12 minutes, decontaminating exterior surfaces, lumens, and accessories. Interchangeable trays are available to permit the processing of up to three rigid endoscopes or one flexible endoscope. Connectors are available for most types of flexible endoscopes for the irrigation of all channels by directed flow. Rigid endoscopes are placed within a lidded container, and the sterilant fills the lumens either by immersion in the circulating sterilant or by use of channel connectors to direct flow into the lumen(s) (see below for the importance of channel connectors). The peracetic acid is discarded via the sewer and the instrument rinsed four times with filtered water. Concern has been raised that filtered water may be inadequate to maintain sterility896. Limited data have shown that low-level bacterial contamination may follow the use of filtered water in an AER but no data has been published on AERs using the peracetic acid system161. Clean filtered air is passed through the chamber of the machine and endoscope channels to remove excess water719. As with any sterilization process, the system can only sterilize surfaces that can be contacted by the sterilant. For example, bronchoscopy-related infections occurred when bronchoscopes were processed using the wrong connector155, 725. Investigation of these incidents revealed that bronchoscopes were inadequately reprocessed when inappropriate channel connectors were used and when there were inconsistencies between the reprocessing instructions provided by the manufacturer of the bronchoscope and the manufacturer of the automatic endoscope reprocessor155. The importance of channel connectors to achieve sterilization was also shown for rigid lumen devices137, 856. The manufacturers suggest the use of biological monitors (G.", "page_start": 65, "page_end": 66, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

The importance of channel connectors to achieve sterilization was also shown for rigid lumen devices137, 856. The manufacturers suggest the use of biological monitors (G. stearothermophilus spore strips) both at the time of installation and routinely to ensure effectiveness of the process. The manufacturer’s clip must be used to hold the strip in the designated spot in the machine as a broader clamp will not allow the sterilant to reach the spores trapped under it897. One investigator reported a 3% failure rate when the appropriate clips were used to hold the spore strip within the machine718. The use of biological monitors designed to monitor either steam sterilization or ETO for a liquid chemical sterilizer has been questioned for several reasons including spore wash-off from the filter paper strips which may cause less valid monitoring898-901. The processor is equipped with a conductivity probe that will automatically abort the cycle if the buffer system is not detected in a fresh container of the peracetic acid solution. A chemical monitoring strip that detects that the active ingredient is >1500 ppm is available for routine use as an additional process control. Mode of Action. Only limited information is available regarding the mechanism of action of peracetic acid, but it is thought to function as other oxidizing agents, i.e., it denatures proteins, disrupts cell wall permeability, and oxidizes sulfhydral and sulfur bonds in proteins, enzymes, and other metabolites654, 726. Microbicidal Activity. Peracetic acid will inactivate gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and yeasts in <5 minutes at <100 ppm. In the presence of organic matter, 200-500 ppm is required. For viruses, the dosage range is wide (12-2250 ppm), with poliovirus inactivated in yeast extract in 15 minutes with 1500 to 2250 ppm. Bacterial spores in suspension are inactivated in 15 seconds to 30 minutes with 500 to 10,000 ppm (0.05 to 1%)654. Simulated-use trials have demonstrated microbicidal activity 111, 718-722 and three clinical trials have demonstrated both microbial killing and no clinical failures leading to infection90, 723, 724. Alfa and co- workers, who compared the peracetic acid system with ETO, demonstrated the high efficacy of the system. Only the peracetic acid system was able to completely kill 6-log10 of Mycobacterium chelonae, Enterococcus faecalis, and B. atrophaeus spores with both an organic and inorganic challenge722. Like other sterilization processes, the efficacy of the process can be diminished by soil challenges 902 and test conditions856. Uses.

Microbicidal Activity of Low-Temperature Sterilization Technologies Sterilization processes used in the United States must be cleared by FDA, and they require that sterilizer microbicidal performance be tested under simulated-use conditions904. FDA requires that the test article be inoculated with 106 colony-forming units of the most resistant test organism and prepared with organic and inorganic test loads as would occur after actual use. FDA requires manufacturers to use organic soil (e.g., 5% fetal calf serum), dried onto the device with the inoculum, to represent soil remaining on the device following marginal cleaning. However, 5% fetal calf serum as a measure of marginal cleaning has not been validated by measurements of protein load on devices following use and the level of protein removal by various cleaning methods. The inocula must be placed in various locations of the test articles, including those least favorable to penetration and contact with the sterilant (e.g., lumens). Cleaning before sterilization is not allowed in the demonstration of sterilization efficacy904. Several studies have evaluated the relative microbicidal efficacy of these low-temperature sterilization technologies (Table 11). These studies have either tested the activity of a sterilization process against specific microorganisms892, 905, 906, evaluated the microbicidal activity of a singular technology 711, 719, 724, 855, 879, 882-884, 890, 891, 907 or evaluated the comparative effectiveness of several sterilization technologies271, 426, 469, 721, 722, 856, 908, 909. Several test methodologies use stainless steel or porcelain carriers that are inoculated with a test organism. Commonly used test organisms include vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria, and spores of Bacillus species. The available data demonstrate that low-temperature sterilization technologies are able to provide a 6-log10 reduction of microbes when inoculated onto carriers in the absence of salt and serum. However, tests can be constructed such that all of the available sterilization technologies are unable to reliably achieve complete inactivation of a microbial load. 425, 426, 469, 721, 856, 909 For example, almost all of the sterilization processes will fail to reliably inactivate the microbial load in the presence of salt and serum469, 721, 909. The effect of salts and serums on the sterilization process were studied initially in the 1950s and 1960s424, 910.

These studies showed that a high concentration of crystalline-type materials and a low protein content provided greater protection to spores than did serum with a high protein content426. A study by Doyle and Ernst demonstrated resistance of spores by crystalline material applied not only to low-temperature sterilization technology but also to steam and dry heat425. These studies showed that occlusion of Bacillus atrophaeus spores in calcium carbonate crystals dramatically increased the time required for inactivation as follows: 10 seconds to 150 minutes for steam (121°C), 3.5 hours to 50 hours for dry heat (121°C), 30 seconds to >2 weeks for ETO (54°C). Investigators have corroborated and extended these findings469, 470, 721, 855, 908, 909. While soils containing both organic and inorganic materials impair microbial killing, soils that contain a high inorganic salt-to-protein ratio favor crystal formation and impair sterilization by occlusion of organisms425, 426, 881. Alfa and colleagues demonstrated a 6-log10 reduction of the microbial inoculum of porcelain penicylinders using a variety of vegetative and spore-forming organisms (Table 11)469. However, if the bacterial inoculum was in tissue-culture medium supplemented with 10% serum, only the ETO 12/88 and ETO-HCFC sterilization mixtures could sterilize 95% to 97% of the penicylinder carriers. The plasma and 100% ETO sterilizer demonstrated significantly reduced activity (Table 11). For all sterilizers evaluated using penicylinder carriers (i.e., ETO 12/88, 100% ETO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma), there was a 3- to 6-log10 reduction of inoculated bacteria even in the presence of serum and salt. For each sterilizer evaluated, the ability to inactivate microorganisms in the presence of salt and serum was reduced even further when the inoculum was placed in a narrow-lumen test object (3 mm diameter by 125 cm long). Although there was a 2- to 4-log10 reduction in microbial kill, less than 50% of the lumen test objects were sterile when processed using any of the sterilization methods evaluated except the peracetic acid immersion system (Table 11)721. Complete killing (or removal) of 6-log10 of Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium chelonei, and Bacillus atrophaeus spores in the presence of salt and serum and lumen test objects was observed only for the peracetic acid immersion system.

Jacobs et al. showed that microorganisms mixed with tissue culture media, used as a surrogate body fluid, formed physical crystals that protected the microorganisms used as a challenge. If the carriers were exposed for 60 sec to nonflowing water, the salts dissolved and the protective effect disappeared. Since any device would be exposed to water for a short period of time during the washing procedure, these protective effects would have little clinical relevance426. Narrow lumens provide a challenge to some low-temperature sterilization processes. For example, Rutala and colleagues showed that, as lumen size decreased, increased failures occurred with some low- temperature sterilization technologies. However, some low-temperature processes such as ETO-HCFC and the hydrogen peroxide gas plasma process remained effective even when challenged by a lumen as small as 1 mm in the absence of salt and serum856. The importance of allowing the sterilant to come into contact with the inoculated carrier is demonstrated by comparing the results of two investigators who studied the peracetic acid immersion system. Alfa and coworkers demonstrated excellent activity of the peracetic acid immersion system against three test organisms using a narrow-lumen device. In these experiments, the lumen test object was connected to channel irrigators, which ensured that the sterilant had direct contact with the contaminated carriers722. This effectiveness was achieved through a combination of organism wash-off and peracetic acid sterilant killing the test organisms722. The data reported by Rutala et al. demonstrated failure of the peracetic acid immersion system to eliminate Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores from a carrier placed in a lumen test object. In these experiments, the lumen test unit was not connected to channel irrigators. The authors attributed the failure of the peracetic acid immersion system to eliminate the high levels of spores from the center of the test unit to the inability of the peracetic acid to diffuse into the center of 40-cm long, 3-mm diameter tubes. This may be caused by an air lock or air bubbles formed in the lumen, impeding the flow of the sterilant through the long and narrow lumen and limiting complete access to the Bacillus spores137, 856. Experiments using a channel connector specifically designed for 1-, 2-, and 3-mm lumen test units with the peracetic acid immersion system were completely effective in eliminating an inoculum of 106 Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores7. The restricted diffusion environment that exists in the test conditions would not exist with flexible scopes processed in the peracetic acid immersion system, because the scopes are connected to channel irrigators to ensure that the sterilant has direct contact with contaminated surfaces.

Bioburden of Surgical Devices In general, used medical devices are contaminated with a relatively low bioburden of organisms179, 911, 912.Nystrom evaluated medical instruments used in general surgical, gynecological, orthopedic, and ear- nose-throat operations and found that 62% of the instruments were contaminated with <101 organisms after use, 82% with <102, and 91% with <103. After being washed in an instrument washer, more than 98% of the instruments had <101 organisms, and none >102 organisms911. Other investigators have published similar findings179, 912. For example, after a standard cleaning procedure, 72% of 50 surgical instruments contained <101 organisms, 86% <102, and only 6% had >3 X 102912. In another study of rigid- lumen medical devices, the bioburden on both the inner and outer surface of the lumen ranged from 101 to 104 organisms per device. After cleaning, 83% of the devices had a bioburden ≤102 organisms179. In all of these studies, the contaminating microflora consisted mainly of vegetative bacteria, usually of low pathogenicity (e.g., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus)179, 911, 912. An evaluation of the microbial load on used critical medical devices such as spinal anesthesia needles and angiographic catheters and sheaths demonstrated that mesophilic microorganisms were detected at levels of 101 to 102 in only two of five needles. The bioburden on used angiographic catheters Last update: June 2024 68 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) and sheath introducers exceeded 103 CFUs on 14% (3 of 21) and 21% (6 of 28), respectively907. Effect of Cleaning on Sterilization Efficacy The effect of salt and serum on the efficacy of low-temperature sterilization technologies has raised concern regarding the margin of safety of these technologies. Experiments have shown that salts have the greatest impact on protecting microorganisms from killing426, 469. However, other studies have suggested that these concerns may not be clinically relevant. One study evaluated the relative rate of removal of inorganic salts, organic soil, and microorganisms from medical devices to better understand the dynamics of the cleaning process426. These tests were conducted by inoculating Alfa soil (tissue- culture media and 10% fetal bovine serum) 469 containing 106 G. stearothermophilus spores onto the surface of a stainless-steel scalpel blade. After drying for 30 minutes at 35°C followed by 30 minutes at room temperature, the samples were placed in water at room temperature. The blades were removed at specified times, and the concentration of total protein and chloride ion was measured.

The blades were removed at specified times, and the concentration of total protein and chloride ion was measured. The results showed that soaking in deionized water for 60 seconds resulted in a >95% release rate of chloride ion from NaCl solution in 20 seconds, Alfa soil in 30 seconds, and fetal bovine serum in 120 seconds. Thus, contact with water for short periods, even in the presence of protein, rapidly leads to dissolution of salt crystals and complete inactivation of spores by a low-temperature sterilization process (Table 10). Based on these experimental data, cleaning procedures would eliminate the detrimental effect of high salt content on a low-temperature sterilization process. These articles 426, 469, 721 assessing low-temperature sterilization technology reinforce the importance of meticulous cleaning before sterilization. These data support the critical need for healthcare facilities to develop rigid protocols for cleaning contaminated objects before sterilization472. Sterilization of instruments and medical devices is compromised if the process is not preceded by meticulous cleaning. The cleaning of any narrow-lumen medical device used in patient care presents a major challenge to reprocessing areas. While attention has been focused on flexible endoscopes, cleaning issues related to other narrow-lumen medical devices such as sphinctertomes have been investigated913. This study compared manual cleaning with that of automated cleaning with a narrow-lumen cleaner and found that only retro-flushing with the narrow lumen cleaner provided adequate cleaning of the three channels. If reprocessing was delayed for more than 24 hours, retro-flush cleaning was no longer effective and ETO sterilization failure was detected when devices were held for 7 days 913. In another study involving simulated-use cleaning of laparoscopic devices, Alfa found that minimally the use of retro-flushing should be used during cleaning of non-ported laparoscopic devices914. Other Sterilization Methods Ionizing Radiation. Sterilization by ionizing radiation, primarily by cobalt 60 gamma rays or electron accelerators, is a low-temperature sterilization method that has been used for a number of medical products (e.g., tissue for transplantation, pharmaceuticals, medical devices). There are no FDA-cleared ionizing radiation sterilization processes for use in healthcare facilities. Because of high sterilization costs, this method is an unfavorable alternative to ETO and plasma sterilization in healthcare facilities but is suitable for large-scale sterilization. Some deleterious effects on patient-care equipment associated with gamma radiation include induced oxidation in polyethylene 915 and delamination and cracking in polyethylene knee bearings916. Several reviews 917, 918 dealing with the sources, effects, and application of ionizing radiation may be referred to for more detail. Dry-Heat Sterilizers.

The advantages for dry heat include the following: it is nontoxic and does not harm the environment; a dry heat cabinet is easy to install and has relatively low operating costs; it penetrates materials; and it is noncorrosive for metal and sharp instruments. The disadvantages for dry heat are the slow rate of heat penetration and microbial killing makes this a time-consuming method. In addition, the high temperatures Last update: June 2024 69 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) are not suitable for most materials919. The most common time-temperature relationships for sterilization with hot air sterilizers are 170°C (340°F) for 60 minutes, 160°C (320°F) for 120 minutes, and 150°C (300°F) for 150 minutes. B. atrophaeus spores should be used to monitor the sterilization process for dry heat because they are more resistant to dry heat than are G. stearothermophilus spores. The primary lethal process is considered to be oxidation of cell constituents. There are two types of dry-heat sterilizers: the static-air type and the forced-air type. The static-air type is referred to as the oven-type sterilizer as heating coils in the bottom of the unit cause the hot air to rise inside the chamber via gravity convection. This type of dry-heat sterilizer is much slower in heating, requires longer time to reach sterilizing temperature, and is less uniform in temperature control throughout the chamber than is the forced-air type. The forced-air or mechanical convection sterilizer is equipped with a motor-driven blower that circulates heated air throughout the chamber at a high velocity, permitting a more rapid transfer of energy from the air to the instruments920. Liquid Chemicals. Several FDA-cleared liquid chemical sterilants include indications for sterilization of medical devices (Tables 4 and 5)69. The indicated contact times range from 3 hours to 12 hours. However, except for a few of the products, the contact time is based only on the conditions to pass the AOAC Sporicidal Test as a sterilant and not on simulated use testing with devices. These solutions are commonly used as high-level disinfectants when a shorter processing time is required. Generally, chemical liquid sterilants cannot be monitored using a biological indicator to verify sterility899, 900. The survival kinetics for thermal sterilization methods, such as steam and dry heat, have been studied and characterized extensively, whereas the kinetics for sterilization with liquid sterilants are less well understood921. The information that is available in the literature suggests that sterilization processes based on liquid chemical sterilants, in general, may not convey the same sterility assurance level as sterilization achieved using thermal or physical methods823.

The survival kinetics for thermal sterilization methods, such as steam and dry heat, have been studied and characterized extensively, whereas the kinetics for sterilization with liquid sterilants are less well understood921. The information that is available in the literature suggests that sterilization processes based on liquid chemical sterilants, in general, may not convey the same sterility assurance level as sterilization achieved using thermal or physical methods823. The data indicate that the survival curves for liquid chemical sterilants may not exhibit log-linear kinetics and the shape of the survivor curve may vary depending of the formulation, chemical nature and stability of the liquid chemical sterilant. In addition, the design of the AOAC Sporicidal Test does not provide quantification of the microbial challenge. Therefore, sterilization with a liquid chemical sterilant may not convey the same sterility assurance as other sterilization methods. One of the differences between thermal and liquid chemical processes for sterilization of devices is the accessibility of microorganisms to the sterilant. Heat can penetrate barriers, such as biofilm, tissue, and blood, to attain organism kill, whereas liquids cannot adequately penetrate these barriers. In addition, the viscosity of some liquid chemical sterilants impedes their access to organisms in the narrow lumens and mated surfaces of devices922. Another limitation to sterilization of devices with liquid chemical germicides is the post-processing environment of the device. Devices cannot be wrapped or adequately contained during processing in a liquid chemical sterilant to maintain sterility following processing and during storage. Furthermore, devices may require rinsing following exposure to the liquid chemical sterilant with water that typically is not sterile. Therefore, due to the inherent limitations of using liquid chemical sterilants, their use should be restricted to reprocessing critical devices that are heat-sensitive and incompatible with other sterilization methods. Several published studies compare the sporicidal effect of liquid chemical germicides against spores of Bacillus and Clostridium78, 659, 660, 715. Performic Acid. Performic acid is a fast-acting sporicide that was incorporated into an automated endoscope reprocessing system400. Systems using performic acid are not currently FDA cleared. Filtration. Although filtration is not a lethality-based process and is not an FDA-cleared sterilization method, this technology is used to remove bacteria from thermolabile pharmaceutical fluids that cannot be purified by any other means. In order to remove bacteria, the membrane pore size (e.g., 0.22 μm) Last update: June 2024 70 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) must be smaller than the bacteria and uniform throughout923. Some investigators have appropriately questioned whether the removal of microorganisms by filtration really is a sterilization method because of slight bacterial passage through filters, viral passage through filters, and transference of the sterile filtrate into the final container under aseptic conditions entail a risk of contamination924. Microwave. Microwaves are used in medicine for disinfection of soft contact lenses, dental instruments, dentures, milk, and urinary catheters for intermittent self-catheterization925-931.

However, microwaves must only be used with products that are compatible (e.g., do not melt) 931. Microwaves are radio-frequency waves, which are usually used at a frequency of 2450 MHz. The microwaves produce friction of water molecules in an alternating electrical field. The intermolecular friction derived from the vibrations generates heat and some authors believe that the effect of microwaves depends on the heat produced while others postulate a nonthermal lethal effect932-934. The initial reports showed microwaves to be an effective microbicide. The microwaves produced by a \"home-type\" microwave oven (2.45 GHz) completely inactivate bacterial cultures, mycobacteria, viruses, and G. stearothermophilus spores within 60 seconds to 5 minutes depending on the challenge organism933, 935-937. Another study confirmed these resuIts but also found that higher power microwaves in the presence of water may be needed for sterilization932. Complete destruction of Mycobacterium bovis was obtained with 4 minutes of microwave exposure (600W, 2450 MHz)937. The effectiveness of microwave ovens for different sterilization and disinfection purposes should be tested and demonstrated as test conditions affect the results (e.g., presence of water, microwave power). Sterilization of metal instruments can be accomplished but requires certain precautions.926. Of concern is that home-type microwave ovens may not have even distribution of microwave energy over the entire dry device (there may be hot and cold spots on solid medical devices); hence there may be areas that are not sterilized or disinfected. The use of microwave ovens to disinfect intermittent-use catheters also has been suggested. Researchers found that test bacteria (e.g., E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans) were eliminated from red rubber catheters within 5 minutes 931. Microwaves used for sterilization of medical devices have not been FDA cleared. Glass Bead “Sterilizer”. Glass bead “sterilization” uses small glass beads (1.2-1.5 mm diameter) and high temperature (217 °C -232°C) for brief exposure times (e.g., 45 seconds) to inactivate microorganisms. These devices have been used for several years in the dental profession938-940. FDA believes there is a risk of infection with this device because of potential failure to sterilize dental instruments and their use should be discontinued until the device has received FDA clearance. Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide (VHP). Hydrogen peroxide solutions have been used as chemical sterilants for many years. However, the VHP was not developed for the sterilization of medical equipment until the mid-1980s. One method for delivering VHP to the reaction site uses a deep vacuum to pull liquid hydrogen peroxide (30-35% concentration) from a disposable cartridge through a heated vaporizer and then, following vaporization, into the sterilization chamber.

A second approach to VHP delivery is the flow-through approach in which the VHP is carried into the sterilization chamber by a carrier gas such as air using either a slight negative pressure (vacuum) or slight positive pressure. Applications of this technology include vacuum systems for industrial sterilization of medical devices and atmospheric systems for decontaminating for large and small areas853. VHP offers several appealing features that include rapid cycle time (e.g., 30-45 minutes); low temperature; environmentally safe by-products (H2O, oxygen [O2]); good material compatibility; and ease of operation, installation and monitoring. VHP has limitations including that cellulose cannot be processed; nylon becomes brittle; and VHP penetration capabilities are less than those of ETO. Content edits were made for clarification. Update [June 2024] The feasibility of utilizing vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide as a surface decontaminant and sterilizer was evaluated in a centrifuge decontamination application. In this study, vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide was shown to possess significant sporicidal activity 941. In preliminary studies, hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination has been found to be a highly effective method of eradicating MRSA, Serratia Last update: June 2024 71 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) marcescens, Clostridium botulinum spores and Clostridium difficile from rooms, furniture, surfaces and/or equipment; however, further investigation of this method to demonstrate both safety and effectiveness in reducing infection rates are required942-945. Ozone. Ozone has been used for years as a drinking water disinfectant. Ozone is produced when O2 is energized and split into two monatomic (O1) molecules. The monatomic oxygen molecules then collide with O2 molecules to form ozone, which is O3. Thus, ozone consists of O2 with a loosely bonded third oxygen atom that is readily available to attach to, and oxidize, other molecules. This additional oxygen atom makes ozone a powerful oxidant that destroys microorganisms but is highly unstable (i.e., half-life of 22 minutes at room temperature). A new sterilization process, which uses ozone as the sterilant, was cleared by FDA in August 2003 for processing reusable medical devices. The sterilizer creates its own sterilant internally from USP grade oxygen, steam-quality water and electricity; the sterilant is converted back to oxygen and water vapor at the end of the cycle by a passing through a catalyst before being exhausted into the room. The duration of the sterilization cycle is about 4 h and 15 m, and it occurs at 30-35°C. Microbial efficacy has been demonstrated by achieving a SAL of 10-6 with a variety of microorganisms to include the most resistant microorganism, Geobacillus stearothermophilus. The ozone process is compatible with a wide range of commonly used materials including stainless steel, titanium, anodized aluminum, ceramic, glass, silica,", "page_start": 71, "page_end": 72, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

The ozone process is compatible with a wide range of commonly used materials including stainless steel, titanium, anodized aluminum, ceramic, glass, silica, PVC, Teflon, silicone, polypropylene, polyethylene and acrylic. In addition, rigid lumen devices of the following diameter and length can be processed: internal diameter (ID): > 2 mm, length ≤ 25 cm; ID > 3 mm, length ≤ 47 cm; and ID > 4 mm, length ≤ 60 cm. The process should be safe for use by the operator because there is no handling of the sterilant, no toxic emissions, no residue to aerate, and low operating temperature means there is no danger of an accidental burn. The cycle is monitored using a self-contained biological indicator and a chemical indicator. The sterilization chamber is small, about 4 ft3 (Written communication, S Dufresne, July 2004). A gaseous ozone generator was investigated for decontamination of rooms used to house patients colonized with MRSA. The results demonstrated that the device tested would be inadequate for the decontamination of a hospital room946. Formaldehyde Steam. Low-temperature steam with formaldehyde is used as a low-temperature sterilization method in many countries, particularly in Scandinavia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The process involves the use of formalin, which is vaporized into a formaldehyde gas that is admitted into the sterilization chamber. A formaldehyde concentration of 8-16 mg/l is generated at an operating temperature of 70-75°C. The sterilization cycle consists of a series of stages that include an initial vacuum to remove air from the chamber and load, followed by steam admission to the chamber with the vacuum pump running to purge the chamber of air and to heat the load, followed by a series of pulses of formaldehyde gas, followed by steam. Formaldehyde is removed from the sterilizer and load by repeated alternate evacuations and flushing with steam and air. This system has some advantages, e.g., the cycle time for formaldehyde gas is faster than that for ETO and the cost per cycle is relatively low. However, ETO is more penetrating and operates at lower temperatures than do steam/formaldehyde sterilizers. Low-temperature steam formaldehyde sterilization has been found effective against vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria, B. atrophaeus and G. stearothermophilus spores and Candida albicans947-949. Formaldehyde vapor cabinets also may be used in healthcare facilities to sterilize heat-sensitive medical equipment950. Commonly, there is no circulation of formaldehyde and no temperature and humidity controls. The release of gas from paraformaldehyde tablets (placed on the lower tray) is slow and produces a low partial pressure of gas. The microbicidal quality of this procedure is unknown951.

Studies indicate that formaldehyde is a mutagen and a potential human carcinogen, and OSHA regulates formaldehyde. The permissible exposure limit for formaldehyde in work areas is 0.75 ppm measured as a 8-hour TWA. The OSHA standard includes a 2 ppm STEL (i.e., maximum exposure allowed during a 15-minute period). As with the ETO standard, the formaldehyde standard requires that the employer conduct initial monitoring to identify employees who are exposed to formaldehyde at or above the action level or STEL. If this exposure level is maintained, employers may discontinue exposure monitoring until there is a change that could affect exposure levels or an employee reports formaldehyde- related signs and symptoms269, 578. The formaldehyde steam sterilization system has not been FDA cleared for use in healthcare facilities. Gaseous chlorine dioxide. A gaseous chlorine dioxide system for sterilization of healthcare products was developed in the late 1980s853, 952, 953. Chlorine dioxide is not mutagenic or carcinogenic in humans. As the chlorine dioxide concentration increases, the time required to achieve sterilization becomes progressively shorter. For example, only 30 minutes were required at 40 mg/l to sterilize the 106 B. atrophaeus spores at 30° to 32°C954. Currently, no gaseous chlorine dioxide system is FDA cleared. Vaporized Peracetic Acid. The sporicidal activity of peracetic acid vapor at 20, 40, 60, and 80% relative humidity and 25°C was determined on Bacillus atrophaeus spores on paper and glass surfaces. Appreciable activity occurred within 10 minutes of exposure to 1 mg of peracetic acid per liter at 40% or higher relative humidity955. No vaporized peracetic acid system is FDA cleared. Infrared radiation. An infrared radiation prototype sterilizer was investigated and found to destroy B. atrophaeus spores. Some of the possible advantages of infrared technology include short cycle time, low energy consumption, no cycle residuals, and no toxicologic or environmental effects. This may provide an alternative technology for sterilization of selected heat-resistant instruments but there are no FDA-cleared systems for use in healthcare facilities 956. The other sterilization technologies mentioned above may be used for sterilization of critical medical items if cleared by the FDA and ideally, the microbicidal effectiveness of the technology has been published in the scientific literature. The selection and use of disinfectants, chemical sterilants and sterilization processes in the healthcare field is dynamic, and products may become available that are not in existence when this guideline was written.

As newer disinfectants and sterilization processes become available, persons or committees responsible for selecting disinfectants and sterilization processes should be guided by products cleared by FDA and EPA as well as information in the scientific literature. Sterilizing Practices Overview. The delivery of sterile products for use in patient care depends not only on the effectiveness of the sterilization process but also on the unit design, decontamination, disassembling and packaging of the device, loading the sterilizer, monitoring, sterilant quality and quantity, and the appropriateness of the cycle for the load contents, and other aspects of device reprocessing. Healthcare personnel should perform most cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing of patient-care supplies in a central processing department in order to more easily control quality. The aim of central processing is the orderly processing of medical and surgical instruments to protect patients from infections while minimizing risks to staff and preserving the value of the items being reprocessed957. Healthcare facilities should promote the same level of efficiency and safety in the preparation of supplies in other areas (e.g., operating room, respiratory therapy) as is practiced in central processing. Ensuring consistency of sterilization practices requires a comprehensive program that ensures operator competence and proper methods of cleaning and wrapping instruments, loading the sterilizer, operating the sterilizer, and monitoring of the entire process. Furthermore, care must be consistent from Last update: June 2024 73 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) an infection prevention standpoint in all patient-care settings, such as hospital and outpatient facilities. Sterilization Cycle Verification. A sterilization process should be verified before it is put into use in healthcare settings. All steam, ETO, and other low-temperature sterilizers are tested with biological and chemical indicators upon installation, when the sterilizer is relocated, redesigned, after major repair and after a sterilization failure has occurred to ensure they are functioning prior to placing them into routine use. Three consecutive empty steam cycles are run with a biological and chemical indicator in an appropriate test package or tray. Each type of steam cycle used for sterilization (e.g., vacuum-assisted, gravity) is tested separately. In a prevacuum steam sterilizer three consecutive empty cycles are also run with a Bowie-Dick test. The sterilizer is not put back into use until all biological indicators are negative and chemical indicators show a correct end-point response811-814, 819, 958. Biological and chemical indicator testing is also done for ongoing quality assurance testing of representative samples of actual products being sterilized and product testing when major changes are made in packaging, wraps, or", "page_start": 73, "page_end": 74, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

Biological and chemical indicator testing is also done for ongoing quality assurance testing of representative samples of actual products being sterilized and product testing when major changes are made in packaging, wraps, or load configuration. Biological and chemical indicators are placed in products, which are processed in a full load. When three consecutive cycles show negative biological indicators and chemical indicators with a correct end point response, you can put the change made into routine use811-814, 958. Items processed during the three evaluation cycles should be quarantined until the test results are negative. Physical Facilities. The central processing area(s) ideally should be divided into at least three areas: decontamination, packaging, and sterilization and storage. Physical barriers should separate the decontamination area from the other sections to contain contamination on used items. In the decontamination area reusable contaminated supplies (and possibly disposable items that are reused) are received, sorted, and decontaminated. The recommended airflow pattern should contain contaminates within the decontamination area and minimize the flow of contaminates to the clean areas. The American Institute of Architects 959 recommends negative pressure and no fewer than six air exchanges per hour in the decontamination area (AAMI recommends 10 air changes per hour) and 10 air changes per hour with positive pressure in the sterilizer equipment room. The packaging area is for inspecting, assembling, and packaging clean, but not sterile, material. The sterile storage area should be a limited access area with a controlled temperature (may be as high as 75°F) and relative humidity (30- 60% in all works areas except sterile storage, where the relative humidity should not exceed 70%)819. The floors and walls should be constructed of materials capable of withstanding chemical agents used for cleaning or disinfecting. Ceilings and wall surfaces should be constructed of non-shedding materials. Physical arrangements of processing areas are presented schematically in four references811, 819, 920, 957. Cleaning. As repeatedly mentioned, items must be cleaned using water with detergents or enzymatic cleaners 465, 466, 468 before processing. Cleaning reduces the bioburden and removes foreign material (i.e., organic residue and inorganic salts) that interferes with the sterilization process by acting as a barrier to the sterilization agent179, 426, 457, 911, 912. Surgical instruments are generally presoaked or prerinsed to prevent drying of blood and tissue. Precleaning in patient-care areas may be needed on items that are heavily soiled with feces, sputum, blood, or other material. Items sent to central processing without removing gross soil may be difficult to clean because of dried secretions and excretions. Cleaning and decontamination should be done as soon as possible after items have been used. Several types of mechanical cleaning machines (e.g., utensil washer-sanitizer, ultrasonic cleaner, washer-sterilizer, dishwasher, washer-disinfector) may facilitate cleaning and decontamination of", "page_start": 74, "page_end": 74, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

Cleaning and decontamination should be done as soon as possible after items have been used. Several types of mechanical cleaning machines (e.g., utensil washer-sanitizer, ultrasonic cleaner, washer-sterilizer, dishwasher, washer-disinfector) may facilitate cleaning and decontamination of most items. This equipment often is automated and may increase productivity, improve cleaning effectiveness, and decrease worker exposure to blood and body fluids. Delicate and intricate objects and heat- or moisture-sensitive articles may require careful cleaning by hand. All used items sent to the central processing area should be considered contaminated (unless decontaminated in the area of origin), handled with gloves (forceps or tongs are sometimes needed to avoid exposure to sharps), and decontaminated by one of the aforementioned methods to render them safer to handle. Items composed of more than one removable part should be disassembled. Care should be taken to ensure that all parts Last update: June 2024 74 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) are kept together, so that reassembly can be accomplished efficiently811. Investigators have described the degree of cleanliness by visual and microscopic examination. One study found 91% of the instruments to be clean visually but, when examined microscopically, 84% of the instruments had residual debris. Sites that contained residual debris included junctions between insulating sheaths and activating mechanisms of laparoscopic instruments and articulations and grooves of forceps. More research is needed to understand the clinical significance of these findings 960 and how to ensure proper cleaning. Personnel working in the decontamination area should wear household-cleaning-type rubber or plastic gloves when handling or cleaning contaminated instruments and devices. Face masks, eye protection such as goggles or full-length faceshields, and appropriate gowns should be worn when exposure to blood and contaminated fluids may occur (e.g., when manually cleaning contaminated devices)961. Contaminated instruments are a source of microorganisms that could inoculate personnel through nonintact skin on the hands or through contact with the mucous membranes of eyes, nose, or mouth214, 811, 813. Reusable sharps that have been in contact with blood present a special hazard. Employees must not reach with their gloved hands into trays or containers that hold these sharps to retrieve them214. Rather, employees should use engineering controls (e.g., forceps) to retrieve these devices. Packaging. Once items are cleaned, dried, and inspected, those requiring sterilization must be wrapped or placed in rigid containers and should be arranged in instrument trays/baskets according to the guidelines provided by the AAMI and other professional organizations454, 811-814, 819, 836, 962. These guidelines state that hinged instruments should be opened; items with removable parts should be disassembled unless the device manufacturer or researchers provide specific instructions or test data to the contrary181; complex instruments should be prepared and sterilized according to device manufacturer’s instructions and", "page_start": 74, "page_end": 75, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

These guidelines state that hinged instruments should be opened; items with removable parts should be disassembled unless the device manufacturer or researchers provide specific instructions or test data to the contrary181; complex instruments should be prepared and sterilized according to device manufacturer’s instructions and test data; devices with concave surfaces should be positioned to facilitate drainage of water; heavy items should be positioned not to damage delicate items; and the weight of the instrument set should be based on the design and density of the instruments and the distribution of metal mass811, 962. While there is no longer a specified sterilization weight limit for surgical sets, heavy metal mass is a cause of wet packs (i.e., moisture inside the case and tray after completion of the sterilization cycle)963. Other parameters that may influence drying are the density of the wraps and the design of the set964. There are several choices in methods to maintain sterility of surgical instruments, including rigid containers, peel-open pouches (e.g., self-sealed or heat-sealed plastic and paper pouches), roll stock or reels (i.e., paper-plastic combinations of tubing designed to allow the user to cut and seal the ends to form a pouch) 454 and sterilization wraps (woven and nonwoven). Healthcare facilities may use all of these packaging options. The packaging material must allow penetration of the sterilant, provide protection against contact contamination during handling, provide an effective barrier to microbial penetration, and maintain the sterility of the processed item after sterilization 965. An ideal sterilization wrap would successfully address barrier effectiveness, penetrability (i.e., allows sterilant to penetrate), aeration (e.g., allows ETO to dissipate), ease of use, drapeability, flexibility, puncture resistance, tear strength, toxicity, odor, waste disposal, linting, cost, and transparency966. Unacceptable packaging for use with ETO (e.g., foil, polyvinylchloride, and polyvinylidene chlorine [kitchen-type transparent wrap]) 814 or hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (e.g., linens and paper) should not be used to wrap medical items. In central processing, double wrapping can be done sequentially or nonsequentially (i.e., simultaneous wrapping). Wrapping should be done in such a manner to avoid tenting and gapping. The sequential wrap uses two sheets of the standard sterilization wrap, one wrapped after the other. This procedure creates a package within a package. The nonsequential process uses two sheets wrapped at the same time so that the wrapping needs to be performed only once.

Multiple layers are still common practice due to the rigors of handling within the facility even though the barrier efficacy of a single sheet of wrap has improved over the years966. Written and illustrated procedures for preparation of items to be packaged should be readily available and used by personnel when packaging procedures are performed454. Loading. All items to be sterilized should be arranged so all surfaces will be directly exposed to the sterilizing agent. Thus, loading procedures must allow for free circulation of steam (or another sterilant) around each item. Historically, it was recommended that muslin fabric packs should not exceed the maximal dimensions, weight, and density of 12 inches wide × 12 inches high × 20 inches long, 12 lbs, and 7.2 lbs per cubic foot, respectively. Due to the variety of textiles and metal/plastic containers on the market, the textile and metal/plastic container manufacturer and the sterilizer manufacturers should be consulted for instructions on pack preparation and density parameters819. There are several important basic principles for loading a sterilizer: allow for proper sterilant circulation; perforated trays should be placed so the tray is parallel to the shelf; nonperforated containers should be placed on their edge (e.g., basins); small items should be loosely placed in wire baskets; and peel packs should be placed on edge in perforated or mesh bottom racks or baskets454, 811, 836. Storage. Studies in the early 1970s suggested that wrapped surgical trays remained sterile for varying periods depending on the type of material used to wrap the trays. Safe storage times for sterile packs vary with the porosity of the wrapper and storage conditions (e.g., open versus closed cabinets). Heat-sealed, plastic peel-down pouches and wrapped packs sealed in 3-mil (3/1000 inch) polyethylene overwrap have been reported to be sterile for as long as 9 months after sterilization. The 3-mil polyethylene is applied after sterilization to extend the shelf life for infrequently used items967. Supplies wrapped in double-thickness muslin comprising four layers, or equivalent, remain sterile for at least 30 days. Any item that has been sterilized should not be used after the expiration date has been exceeded or if the sterilized package is wet, torn, or punctured. Although some hospitals continue to date every sterilized product and use the time-related shelf-life practice, many hospitals have switched to an event-related shelf-life practice. This latter practice recognizes that the product should remain sterile until some event causes the item to become contaminated (e.g., tear in packaging, packaging becomes wet, seal is broken)968. Event-related factors that contribute to the contamination of a product include bioburden (i.e., the amount of contamination in the environment), air movement, traffic, location, humidity, insects, vermin, flooding, storage area space, open/closed shelving, temperature, and the properties of the wrap material966, 969.", "page_start": 76, "page_end": 76, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

There are data that support the event-related shelf-life practice970-972. One study examined the effect of time on the sterile integrity of paper envelopes, peel pouches, and nylon sleeves. The most important finding was the absence of a trend toward an increased rate of contamination over time for any pack when placed in covered storage971. Another evaluated the effectiveness of event-related outdating by microbiologically testing sterilized items. During the 2-year study period, all of the items tested were sterile972. Thus, contamination of a sterile item is event-related and the probability of contamination increases with increased handling973. Following the sterilization process, medical and surgical devices must be handled using aseptic technique in order to prevent contamination. Sterile supplies should be stored far enough from the floor (8 to 10 inches), the ceiling (5 inches unless near a sprinkler head [18 inches from sprinkler head]), and the outside walls (2 inches) to allow for adequate air circulation, ease of cleaning, and compliance with local fire codes (e.g., supplies must be at least 18 inches from sprinkler heads). Medical and surgical supplies should not be stored under sinks or in other locations where they can become wet. Sterile items that become wet are considered contaminated because moisture brings with it microorganisms from the air and surfaces. Closed or covered cabinets are ideal but open shelving may be used for storage. Any package that has fallen or been dropped on the floor must be inspected for damage to the packaging and contents (if the items are breakable). If the package is heat-sealed in impervious plastic and the seal is Last update: June 2024 76 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) still intact, the package should be considered not contaminated. If undamaged, items packaged in plastic need not be reprocessed. Monitoring. The sterilization procedure should be monitored routinely by using a combination of mechanical, chemical, and biological indicators to evaluate the sterilizing conditions and indirectly the microbiologic status of the processed items. The mechanical monitors for steam sterilization include the daily assessment of cycle time and temperature by examining the temperature record chart (or computer printout) and an assessment of pressure via the pressure gauge. The mechanical monitors for ETO include time, temperature, and pressure recorders that provide data via computer printouts, gauges, and/or displays814.

Generally, two essential elements for ETO sterilization (i.e., the gas concentration and humidity) cannot be monitored in healthcare ETO sterilizers. Chemical indicators are convenient, are inexpensive, and indicate that the item has been exposed to the sterilization process. In one study, chemical indicators were more likely than biological indicators to inaccurately indicate sterilization at marginal sterilization times (e.g., 2 minutes)847. Chemical indicators should be used in conjunction with biological indicators, but based on current studies should not replace them because they indicate sterilization at marginal sterilization time and because only a biological indicator consisting of resistant spores can measure the microbial killing power of the sterilization process.847, 974. Chemical indicators are affixed on the outside of each pack to show that the package has been processed through a sterilization cycle, but these indicators do not prove sterilization has been achieved. Preferably, a chemical indicator also should be placed on the inside of each pack to verify sterilant penetration. Chemical indicators usually are either heat-or chemical-sensitive inks that change color when one or more sterilization parameters (e.g., steam-time, temperature, and/or saturated steam; ETO-time, temperature, relative humidity and/or ETO concentration) are present. Chemical indicators have been grouped into five classes based on their ability to monitor one or multiple sterilization parameters813, 819. If the internal and/or external indicator suggests inadequate processing, the item should not be used815. An air-removal test (Bowie-Dick Test) must be performed daily in an empty dynamic-air-removal sterilizer (e.g., prevacuum steam sterilizer) to ensure air removal. Biological indicators are recognized by most authorities as being closest to the ideal monitors of the sterilization process 974, 975 because they measure the sterilization process directly by using the most resistant microorganisms (i.e., Bacillus spores), and not by merely testing the physical and chemical conditions necessary for sterilization. Since the Bacillus spores used in biological indicators are more resistant and present in greater numbers than are the common microbial contaminants found on patient- care equipment, the demonstration that the biological indicator has been inactivated strongly implies that other potential pathogens in the load have been killed844. An ideal biological monitor of the sterilization process should be easy to use, be inexpensive, not be subject to exogenous contamination, provide positive results as soon as possible after the cycle so that corrective action may be accomplished, and provide positive results only when the sterilization parameters (e.g., steam-time, temperature, and/or saturated steam; ETO-time, temperature, relative humidity and/or ETO concentration) are inadequate to kill microbial contaminates847. Biological indicators are the only process indicators that directly monitor the lethality of a given sterilization process.

G. stearothermophilus is incubated at 55-60°C, and B. atrophaeus is incubated at 35-37°C. Steam and low temperature sterilizers (e.g., hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, peracetic acid) should be monitored at least weekly with the appropriate commercial preparation of spores. If a sterilizer is used frequently (e.g., several loads per day), daily use of biological indicators allows earlier discovery of equipment malfunctions or procedural errors and thus minimizes the extent of patient surveillance and Last update: June 2024 77 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) product recall needed in the event of a positive biological indicator811. Each load should be monitored if it contains implantable objects. If feasible, implantable items should not be used until the results of spore tests are known to be negative. Originally, spore-strip biological indicators required up to 7 days of incubation to detect viable spores from marginal cycles (i.e., when few spores remained viable). The next generation of biological indicator was self-contained in plastic vials containing a spore-coated paper strip and a growth media in a crushable glass ampoule. This indicator had a maximum incubation of 48 hours but significant failures could be detected in ≤24 hours. A rapid-readout biological indicator that detects the presence of enzymes of G. stearothermophilus by reading a fluorescent product produced by the enzymatic breakdown of a nonfluorescent substrate has been marketed for the more than 10 years. Studies demonstrate that the sensitivity of rapid-readout tests for steam sterilization (1 hour for 132°C gravity sterilizers, 3 hrs for 121°C gravity and 132°C vacuum sterilizers) parallels that of the conventional sterilization-specific biological indicators 846, 847, 976, 977 and the fluorescent rapid readout results reliably predict 24- and 48-hour and 7- day growth978. The rapid-readout biological indicator is a dual indicator system as it also detects acid metabolites produced during growth of the G. stearothermophilus spores. This system is different from the indicator system consisting of an enzyme system of bacterial origin without spores. Independent comparative data using suboptimal sterilization cycles (e.g., reduced time or temperature) with the enzyme-based indicator system have not been published979.

The indicator has been cleared by the FDA for use in the United States400. The rapid-readout ETO biological indicator detects the presence of B. atrophaeus by detecting a fluorescent signal indicating the activity of an enzyme present within the B. atrophaeus organism, beta- glucosidase. The fluorescence indicates the presence of an active spore-associated enzyme and a sterilization process failure. This indicator also detects acid metabolites produced during growth of the B. atrophaeus spore. Per manufacturer’s data, the enzyme always was detected whenever viable spores were present. This was expected because the enzyme is relatively ETO resistant and is inactivated at a slightly longer exposure time than the spore. The rapid-readout ETO biological indicator can be used to monitor 100% ETO, and ETO-HCFC mixture sterilization cycles. It has not been tested in ETO-CO2 mixture sterilization cycles. The standard biological indicator used for monitoring full-cycle steam sterilizers does not provide reliable monitoring flash sterilizers980. Biological indicators specifically designed for monitoring flash sterilization are now available, and studies comparing them have been published846, 847, 981. Since sterilization failure can occur (about 1% for steam)982, a procedure to follow in the event of positive spore tests with steam sterilization has been provided by CDC and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN). The 1981 CDC recommendation is that \"objects, other than implantable objects, do not need to be recalled because of a single positive spore test unless the steam sterilizer or the sterilization procedure is defective.\" The rationale for this recommendation is that single positive spore tests in sterilizers occur sporadically. They may occur for reasons such as slight variation in the resistance of the spores983, improper use of the sterilizer, and laboratory contamination during culture (uncommon with self-contained spore tests). If the mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure in the steam sterilizer) and chemical (internal and/or external) indicators suggest that the sterilizer was functioning properly, a single positive spore test probably does not indicate sterilizer malfunction but the spore test should be repeated immediately 983. If the spore tests remain positive, use of the sterilizer should be discontinued until it is serviced1. Similarly, AORN states that a single positive spore test does not necessarily indicate a sterilizer failure. If the test is positive, the sterilizer should immediately be rechallenged for proper use and function. Items, other than implantable ones, do not necessarily need to be recalled unless a sterilizer malfunction is found. If a sterilizer malfunction is discovered, the items must be considered nonsterile, and the items from the suspect load(s) should be recalled, insofar as possible, and reprocessed 984.

A suggested protocol for management of positive biological indicators is shown in Last update: June 2024 78 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Table 12839. A more conservative approach also has been recommended 813 in which any positive spore test is assumed to represent sterilizer malfunction and requires that all materials processed in that sterilizer, dating from the sterilization cycle having the last negative biologic indicator to the next cycle showing satisfactory biologic indicator challenge results, must be considered nonsterile and retrieved, if possible, and reprocessed. This more conservative approach should be used for sterilization methods other than steam (e.g., ETO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma). However, no action is necessary if there is strong evidence for the biological indicator being defective 983 or the growth medium contained a Bacillus contaminant985. If patient-care items were used before retrieval, the infection control professional should assess the risk of infection in collaboration with central processing, surgical services, and risk management staff. The factors that should be considered include the chemical indicator result (e.g., nonreactive chemical indicator may indicate temperature not achieved); the results of other biological indicators that followed the positive biological indicator (e.g., positive on Tuesday, negative on Wednesday); the parameters of the sterilizer associated with the positive biological indicator (e.g., reduced time at correct temperature); the time-temperature chart (or printout); and the microbial load associated with decontaminated surgical instruments (e.g., 85% of decontaminated surgical instruments have less than 100 CFU). The margin of safety in steam sterilization is sufficiently large that there is minimal infection risk associated with items in a load that show spore growth, especially if the item was properly cleaned and the temperature was achieved (e.g., as shown by acceptable chemical indicator or temperature chart). There are no published studies that document disease transmission via a nonretrieved surgical instrument following a sterilization cycle with a positive biological indicator. False-positive biological indicators may occur from improper testing or faulty indicators. The latter may occur from improper storage, processing, product contamination, material failure, or variation in resistance of spores. Gram stain and subculture of a positive biological indicator may determine if a contaminant has created a false-positive result839, 986. However, in one incident, the broth used as growth medium contained a contaminant, B. coagulans, which resulted in broth turbidity at 55°C985. Testing of paired biological indicators from different manufacturers can assist in assessing a product defect839.

A biological indicator should not be considered a false-positive indicator until a thorough analysis of the entire sterilization process shows this to be likely. The size and composition of the biological indicator test pack should be standardized to create a significant challenge to air removal and sterilant penetration and to obtain interpretable results. There is a standard 16-towel pack recommended by AAMI for steam sterilization 813, 819, 987 consisting of 16 clean, preconditioned, reusable huck or absorbent surgical towels each of which is approximately 16 inches by 26 inches. Each towel is folded lengthwise into thirds and then folded widthwise in the middle. One or more biological indicators are placed between the eight and ninth towels in the approximate geometric center of the pack. When the towels are folded and placed one on top of another, to form a stack (approximately 6 inch height) it should weigh approximately 3 pounds and should have a density of approximately 11.3 pounds per cubic foot813. This test pack has not gained universal use as a standard pack that simulates the actual in-use conditions of steam sterilizers. Commercially available disposable test packs that have been shown to be equivalent to the AAMI 16 towel test pack also may be used. The test pack should be placed flat in an otherwise fully loaded sterilizer chamber, in the area least favorable to sterilization (i.e., the area representing the greatest challenge to the biological indicator). This area is normally in the front, bottom section of the sterilizer, near the drain811, 813. A control biological indicator from the lot used for testing should be left unexposed to the sterilant, and then incubated to verify the presterilization viability of the test spores and proper incubation. The most conservative approach would be to use a control for each run; however, less frequent use may be adequate (e.g., weekly). There also is a routine test pack for ETO where a biological indicator is placed in a plastic syringe with plunger, then placed in the folds of a clean surgical towel, and wrapped. Alternatively, commercially available disposal test packs that have been shown to be equivalent to the AAMI test pack may be used. The test pack is placed in the center of the sterilizer load814.

In Europe, biological monitors are not used routinely to monitor the sterilization process. Instead, release of sterilizer items is based on monitoring the physical conditions of the sterilization process that is termed “parametric release.” Parametric release requires that there is a defined quality system in place at the facility performing the sterilization and that the sterilization process be validated for the items being sterilized. At present in Europe, parametric release is accepted for steam, dry heat, and ionizing radiation processes, as the physical conditions are understood and can be monitored directly988. For example, with steam sterilizers the load could be monitored with probes that would yield data on temperature, time, and humidity at representative locations in the chamber and compared to the specifications developed during the validation process. Periodic infection control rounds to areas using sterilizers to standardize the sterilizer’s use may identify correctable variances in operator competence; documentation of sterilization records, including chemical and biological indicator test results; sterilizer maintenance and wrapping; and load numbering of packs. These rounds also may identify improvement activities to ensure that operators are adhering to established standards989. Last update: June 2024 80 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Reuse of Single-Use Medical Devices The reuse of single-use medical devices began in the late 1970s. Before this time most devices were considered reusable. Reuse of single-use devices increased as a cost-saving measure. Approximately 20 to 30% of U.S. hospitals reported that they reuse at least one type of single-use device. Reuse of single- use devices involves regulatory, ethical, medical, legal and economic issues and has been extremely controversial for more than two decades990. The U.S. public has expressed increasing concern regarding the risk of infection and injury when reusing medical devices intended and labeled for single use. Although some investigators have demonstrated it is safe to reuse disposable medical devices such as cardiac electrode catheters, 991-993 additional studies are needed to define the risks 994 and document the benefits. In August 2000, FDA released a guidance document on single-use devices reprocessed by third parties or hospitals995. In this guidance document, FDA states that hospitals or third-party reprocessors will be considered “manufacturers” and regulated in the same manner. A reused single-use device will have to comply with the same regulatory requirements of the device when it was originally manufactured. This document presents FDA’s intent to enforce premarket submission requirements within 6 months (February 2001) for class III devices (e.g., cardiovascular intra-aortic balloon pump, transluminal coronary angioplasty catheter); 12 months (August 2001) for class II devices (e.g., blood pressure cuff, bronchoscope biopsy forceps); and 18 months (February 2002) for class I", "page_start": 80, "page_end": 81, "source": "CDC", "document": "guideline-disinfection-h.pdf"}

FDA uses two types of premarket requirements for nonexempt class I and II devices, a 510(k) submission that may have to show that the device is as safe and effective as the same device when new, and a premarket approval application. The 510(k) submission must provide scientific evidence that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. FDA allowed hospitals a year to comply with the nonpremarket requirements (registration and listing, reporting adverse events associated with medical devices, quality system regulations, and proper labeling). The options for hospitals are to stop reprocessing single-use devices, comply with the rule, or outsource to a third-party reprocessor. FDA guidance document does not apply to permanently implantable pacemakers, hemodialyzers, opened but unused single-use devices, or healthcare settings other than acute-care hospitals. The reuse of single use medical devices continues to be an evolving area of regulations. For this reason, healthcare workers should refer to FDA (http://www.fda.gov/) for the latest guidance 996.

New Categorization Scheme for Updated Recommendations [November 2018] In November 2018, HICPAC voted to approve an updated recommendation scheme. The category Recommendation means that we are confident that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, in the case of a negative recommendation, that the harms clearly exceed the benefits). In general, Recommendations should be supported by high- to moderate-quality evidence. In some circumstances, however, Recommendations may be made based on lesser evidence or even expert opinion when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms or when then Recommendation is required by federal law.

These recommendations refer to the spraying or fogging of chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde, phenol- based agents, or quaternary ammonium compounds) as a way to decontaminate environmental surfaces or disinfect the air in patient rooms. The recommendation against fogging was based on studies in the 1970’s that reported a lack of microbicidal efficacy (e.g., use of quaternary ammonium compounds in mist applications) but also adverse effects on healthcare workers and others in facilities where these methods were utilized. Furthermore, some of these chemicals are not EPA-registered for use in fogging-type applications. These recommendations do not apply to newer technologies involving fogging for room decontamination (e.g., ozone mists, vaporized hydrogen peroxide) that have become available since the 2008 recommendations were made. These newer technologies were assessed by CDC and HICPAC in the 2011 Guideline for the Prevention and Control of Norovirus Gastroenteritis Outbreaks in Healthcare Settings, which makes the recommendation: “More research is required to clarify the effectiveness and reliability of fogging, UV irradiation, and ozone mists to reduce norovirus environmental contamination. (No recommendation/ unresolved issue)” The 2008 recommendations still apply; however, CDC does not yet make a recommendation regarding these newer technologies. This issue will be revisited as additional evidence becomes available. 7. High-Level Disinfection of Endoscopes a.

Category IC. p. Several scientific studies and professional organizations support the efficacy of >2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes at 20oC; that efficacy assumes adequate cleaning prior to disinfection, whereas the FDA-cleared label claim incorporates an added margin of safety to accommodate possible lapses in cleaning practices.

Category IB. 116, 155 8. Management of Equipment and Surfaces in Dentistry a. Dental instruments that penetrate soft tissue or bone (e.g., extraction forceps, scalpel blades, bone chisels, periodontal scalers, and surgical burs) are classified as critical and should be sterilized after each use or discarded. In addition, after each use, sterilize dental instruments that are not intended to penetrate oral soft tissue or bone (e.g., amalgam condensers, air-water syringes) but that might contact oral tissues and are heat-tolerant, although classified as semicritical. Clean and, at a minimum, high-level disinfect heat-sensitive semicritical items. Category IA. 43, 209-211 b. Noncritical clinical contact surfaces, such as uncovered operatory surfaces (e.g., countertops, switches, light handles), should be barrier-protected or disinfected between patients with an intermediate-disinfectant (i.e., EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with a tuberculocidal claim) or low-level disinfectant (i.e., EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with HIV and HBV claim). Category IB. 43, 209-211 c. Barrier protective coverings can be used for noncritical clinical contact surfaces that are touched frequently with gloved hands during the delivery of patient care, that are likely to become contaminated with blood or body substances, or that are difficult to clean. Change these coverings when they are visibly soiled, when they become damaged, and on a routine basis (e.g., between patients). Disinfect protected surfaces at the end of the day or if visibly soiled. Category II. 43, 210 9. Processing Patient-Care Equipment Contaminated with Bloodborne Pathogens (HBV, Hepatitis C Virus, HIV), Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (e.g., Vancomycin- Resistant Enterococci, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis), or Emerging Pathogens (e.g., Cryptosporidium, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Clostridium difficile, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), or Bioterrorist Agents a. Use standard sterilization and disinfection procedures for patient-care equipment (as recommended in this guideline), because these procedures are adequate to sterilize or disinfect instruments or devices contaminated with blood or other body fluids from persons infected with bloodborne pathogens or emerging pathogens, with the exception of prions. No changes in these procedures for cleaning, disinfecting, or sterilizing are necessary for removing bloodborne and emerging pathogens other than prions.

Even if probe covers have been used, clean and high-level disinfect other semicritical devices such as rectal probes, vaginal probes, and cryosurgical probes with a product that is not toxic to staff, patients, probes, and retrieved germ cells (if applicable). Use a high-level disinfectant at the FDA-cleared exposure time. (See Recommendation 7p for exceptions.) Category IB. 6-8, 17, 69 b. When probe covers are available, use a probe cover or condom to reduce the level of microbial contamination. Category II. 197-201 Do not use a lower category of disinfection or cease to follow the appropriate disinfectant recommendations when using probe covers because these sheaths and condoms can fail. Last update: June 2024 91 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Category IB 197-201 c. After high-level disinfection, rinse all items. Use sterile water, filtered water or tapwater followed by an alcohol rinse for semicritical equipment that will have contact with mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract (e.g., nose, pharynx, esophagus). Category II. 10, 31-35, 1017 d. There is no recommendation to use sterile or filtered water rather than tapwater for rinsing semicritical equipment that contact the mucous membranes of the rectum (e.g., rectal probes, anoscope) or vagina (e.g., vaginal probes). Unresolved issue. 11 e. Wipe clean tonometer tips and then disinfect them by immersing for 5-10 minutes in either 5000 ppm chlorine or 70% ethyl alcohol. None of these listed disinfectant products are FDA-cleared high-level disinfectants. Category II. 49, 95, 185, 188, 293 11. Disinfection by Healthcare Personnel in Ambulatory Care and Home Care a. Follow the same classification scheme described above (i.e., that critical devices require sterilization, semicritical devices require high-level disinfection, and noncritical equipment requires low-level disinfection) in the ambulatory-care (outpatient medical/surgical facilities) setting because risk for infection in this setting is similar to that in the hospital setting (see Table 1). Category IB. 6-8, 17, 330 b. When performing care in the home, clean and disinfect reusable objects that touch mucous membranes (e.g., tracheostomy tubes) by immersing these objects in a 1:50 dilution of 5.25%- 6.15% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) (3 minutes), 70% isopropyl alcohol (5 minutes), or 3% hydrogen peroxide (30 minutes) because the home environment is, in most instances, safer than either hospital or ambulatory care settings because person-to-person transmission is less likely. Category II. 327, 328, 330, 331 c.

Institute the following control measures to reduce the occurrence of contaminated disinfectants: 1. prepare the disinfectant correctly to achieve the manufacturer’s recommended use-dilution; and 2. prevent common sources of extrinsic contamination of germicides (e.g., container contamination or surface contamination of the healthcare environment where the germicide are prepared and/or used). Category IB. 404, 406, 1024 13. Flash Sterilization a. Do not flash sterilize implanted surgical devices unless doing so is unavoidable. Category IB. 849, 850 b. Do not use flash sterilization for convenience, as an alternative to purchasing additional instrument sets, or to save time. Category II. 817, 962 c. When using flash sterilization, make sure the following parameters are met: 1. clean the item before placing it in the sterilizing container (that are FDA cleared for use with flash sterilization) or tray; 2. prevent exogenous contamination of the item during transport from the sterilizer to the patient; and 3) monitor sterilizer function with mechanical, chemical, and biologic monitors. Category IB. 812, 819, 846, 847, 962 d. Do not use packaging materials and containers in flash sterilization cycles unless the sterilizer and the packaging material/container are designed for this use. Category IB. 812, 819, 1025 e. When necessary, use flash sterilization for patient-care items that will be used immediately (e.g., to reprocess an inadvertently dropped instrument). Category IB. 812, 817, 819, 845 f. When necessary, use flash sterilization for processing patient-care items that cannot be packaged, sterilized, and stored before use. Category IB. 812, 819 Last update: June 2024 92 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) 14. Methods of Sterilization a. Steam is the preferred method for sterilizing critical medical and surgical instruments that are not damaged by heat, steam, pressure, or moisture. Category IA. 181, 271, 425, 426, 827, 841, 1026, 1027 b. Cool steam- or heat-sterilized items before they are handled or used in the operative setting. Category IB. 850 c.

Completely aerate surgical and medical items that have been sterilized in the EtO sterilizer (e.g., polyvinylchloride tubing requires 12 hours at 50°C, 8 hours at 60°C) before using these items in patient care. Category IB. 814 f. Sterilization using the peracetic acid immersion system can be used to sterilize heat-sensitive immersible medical and surgical items. Category IB. 90, 717-719, 721-724 g. Critical items that have been sterilized by the peracetic acid immersion process must be used immediately (i.e., items are not completely protected from contamination, making long-term storage unacceptable). Category II. 817, 825 h. Dry-heat sterilization (e.g., 340°F for 60 minutes) can be used to sterilize items (e.g., powders, oils) that can sustain high temperatures. Category IB. 815, 827 i. Comply with the sterilizer manufacturer’s instructions regarding the sterilizer cycle parameters (e.g., time, temperature, concentration). Category IB. 155, 725, 811-814, 819 j. Because narrow-lumen devices provide a challenge to all low-temperature sterilization technologies and direct contact is necessary for the sterilant to be effective, ensure that the sterilant has direct contact with contaminated surfaces (e.g., scopes processed in peracetic acid must be connected to channel irrigators). Category IB. 137, 725, 825, 856, 890, 891, 1029 15. Packaging a. Ensure that packaging materials are compatible with the sterilization process and have received FDA 510[k] clearance. Category IB. 811-814, 819, 966 b. Ensure that packaging is sufficiently strong to resist punctures and tears to provide a barrier to microorganisms and moisture. Category IB. 454, 811-814, 819, 966 16. Monitoring of Sterilizers a. Use mechanical, chemical, and biologic monitors to ensure the effectiveness of the sterilization process. Category IB. 811-815, 819, 846, 847, 975-977 b. Monitor each load with mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure) and chemical (internal and external) indicators. If the internal chemical indicator is visible, an external indicator is not needed. Category II. 811-815, 819, 846, 847, 975-977, 980 c. Do not use processed items if the mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure) or chemical (internal and/or external) indicators suggest inadequate processing. Category IB 811-814, 819. d.

These nonsterile items should be retrieved if possible and reprocessed. Category II. 1 Last update: June 2024 93 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) f. After a positive biologic indicator with steam sterilization, objects other than implantable objects do not need to be recalled because of a single positive spore test unless the sterilizer or the sterilization procedure is defective as determined by maintenance personnel or inappropriate cycle settings. If additional spore tests remain positive, consider the items nonsterile and recall and reprocess the items from the implicated load(s). Category II. 1 g. Use biologic indicators for every load containing implantable items and quarantine items, whenever possible, until the biologic indicator is negative. Category IB. 811-814, 819 17. Load Configuration. a. Place items correctly and loosely into the basket, shelf, or cart of the sterilizer so as not to impede the penetration of the sterilant. Category IB. 445, 454, 811, 813, 819, 836 18. Storage of Sterile Items a. Ensure the sterile storage area is a well-ventilated area that provides protection against dust, moisture, insects, and temperature and humidity extremes. Category II. 454, 819, 836, 969 b. Store sterile items so the packaging is not compromised (e.g., punctured, bent). Category II. 454, 816, 819, 968, 969, 1030 c. Label sterilized items with a load number that indicates the sterilizer used, the cycle or load number, the date of sterilization, and, if applicable, the expiration date. Category IB. 811, 812, 814, 816, 819 d. The shelf life of a packaged sterile item depends on the quality of the wrapper, the storage conditions, the conditions during transport, the amount of handling, and other events (moisture) that compromise the integrity of the package. If event-related storage of sterile items is used, then packaged sterile items can be used indefinitely unless the packaging is compromised (see f and g below). Category IB. 816, 819, 836, 968, 973, 1030, 1031 e. Evaluate packages before use for loss of integrity (e.g., torn, wet, punctured).

Quality Control a. Provide comprehensive and intensive training for all staff assigned to reprocess semicritical and critical medical/surgical instruments to ensure they understand the importance of reprocessing these instruments. To achieve and maintain competency, train each member of the staff that reprocesses semicritical and/or critical instruments as follows: 1. provide hands-on training according to the institutional policy for reprocessing critical and semicritical devices; 2. supervise all work until competency is documented for each reprocessing task; 3. conduct competency testing at beginning of employment and regularly thereafter (e.g., annually); and 4. review the written reprocessing instructions regularly to ensure they comply with the scientific literature and the manufacturers’ instructions. Category IB. 6-8, 108, 114, 129, 155, 725, 813, 819 b. Compare the reprocessing instructions (e.g., for the appropriate use of endoscope connectors, the capping/noncapping of specific lumens) provided by the instrument manufacturer and the sterilizer manufacturer and resolve any conflicting recommendations by communicating with both manufacturers. Category IB. 155, 725 c. Conduct infection control rounds periodically (e.g., annually) in high-risk reprocessing areas (e.g., the Gastroenterology Clinic, Central Processing); ensure reprocessing instructions are current and accurate and are correctly implemented. Document all deviations from policy. All stakeholders should identify what corrective actions will be implemented.

Monitor adherence to high-level disinfection and/or sterilization guidelines for endoscopes on a regular basis. This monitoring should include ensuring the proper training of persons performing reprocessing and their adherence to all endoscope reprocessing steps, as demonstrated by competency testing at commencement of employment and annually. 2. Develop a mechanism for the occupational health service to report all adverse health events potentially resulting from exposure to disinfectants and sterilants; review such exposures; and implement engineering, work practice, and PPE to prevent future exposures. 3. Monitor possible sterilization failures that resulted in instrument recall. Assess whether additional training of personnel or equipment maintenance is required.

Antiseptic: substance that prevents or arrests the growth or action of microorganisms by inhibiting their activity or by destroying them. The term is used especially for preparations applied topically to living tissue. Asepsis: prevention of contact with microorganisms. Autoclave: device that sterilizes instruments or other objects using steam under pressure. The length of time required for sterilization depends on temperature, vacuum, and pressure.

The term also refers to the estimated number of bacteria per unit sample, usually expressed as number of colony-forming units. Bactericide: agent that kills bacteria. Bioburden: number and types of viable microorganisms with which an item is contaminated; also called bioload or microbial load. Biofilm: accumulated mass of bacteria and extracellular material that is tightly adhered to a surface and cannot be easily removed. Biologic indicator: device for monitoring the sterilization process. The device consists of a standardized, viable population of microorganisms (usually bacterial spores) known to be resistant to the sterilization process being monitored. Biologic indicators are intended to demonstrate whether conditions were adequate to achieve sterilization. A negative biologic indicator does not prove that all items in the load are sterile or that they were all exposed to adequate sterilization conditions. Bleach: Household bleach (that includes 5.25% or 6.00%–6.15% sodium hypochlorite depending on manufacturer) is usually diluted in water at 1:10 or 1:100. Approximate dilutions are 1.5 cups of bleach in a gallon of water for a 1:10 dilution (~6,000 ppm) and 0.25 cup of bleach in a gallon of water for a 1:100 dilution (~600 ppm). Sodium hypochlorite products that make pesticidal claims, such as sanitization or disinfection, must be registered by EPA and be labeled with an EPA Registration Number.

Challenge test pack: pack used in installation, qualification, and ongoing quality assurance testing of health-care facility sterilizers. Chemical indicator: device for monitoring a sterilization process. The device is designed to respond with a characteristic chemical or physical change to one or more of the physical conditions within the sterilizing chamber. Chemical indicators are intended to detect potential sterilization failures that could result from incorrect packaging, incorrect loading of the sterilizer, or malfunctions of the sterilizer. The “pass” response of a chemical indicator does not prove the item accompanied by the indicator is necessarily sterile. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation has defined five classes of chemical indicators: Class 1 (process indicator); Class 2 (Bowie-Dick test indicator); Class 3 (single- parameter indicator); Class 4 (multi-parameter indicator); and Class 5 (integrating indicator). Contact time: time a disinfectant is in direct contact with the surface or item to be disinfected. For surface disinfection, this period is framed by the application to the surface until complete drying has occurred.

It refers to substances applied to inanimate objects. EPA groups disinfectants by product label claims of “limited,” “general,” or “hospital” disinfection. Disinfection: thermal or chemical destruction of pathogenic and other types of microorganisms. Disinfection is less lethal than sterilization because it destroys most recognized pathogenic microorganisms but not necessarily all microbial forms (e.g., bacterial spores). D value: time or radiation dose required to inactivate 90% of a population of the test microorganism under stated exposure conditions. Endoscope: an instrument that allows examination and treatment of the interior of the body canals and hollow organs.

No.: a hyphenated, two- or three-part number assigned by EPA to identify each germicidal product registered within the United States. The first number is the company identification number, the second is the specific product number, and the third (when present) is the company identification number for a supplemental registrant. Exposure time: period in a sterilization process during which items are exposed to the sterilant at the specified sterilization parameters. For example, in a steam sterilization process, exposure time is the period during which items are exposed to saturated steam at the specified temperature. Flash sterilization: process designed for the steam sterilization of unwrapped patient-care items for immediate use (or placed in a specially designed, covered, rigid container to allow for rapid penetration of steam).

One-step disinfection process: simultaneous cleaning and disinfection of a noncritical surface or item. Pasteurization: process developed by Louis Pasteur of heating milk, wine, or other liquids to 65–77°C (or the equivalent) for approximately 30 minutes to kill or markedly reduce the number of pathogenic and spoilage organisms other than bacterial spores. Parametric release: declaration that a product is sterile on the basis of physical and/or chemical process data rather than on sample testing or biologic indicator results. Penicylinder: carriers inoculated with the test bacteria for in vitro tests of germicides.

Permissible exposure limit (PEL): time-weighted average maximum concentration of an air contaminant to which a worker can be exposed, according to OSHA standards. Usually calculated over 8 hours, with exposure considered over a 40-hour work week. Personal protective equipment (PPE): specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protection against a hazard. General work clothes (e.g., uniforms, pants, shirts) not intended to function as protection against a hazard are not considered to be PPE. Parts per million (ppm): common measurement for concentrations by volume of trace contaminant gases in the air (or chemicals in a liquid); 1 volume of contaminated gas per 1 million volumes of contaminated air or 1¢ in $10,000 both equal 1 ppm.

Prions: transmissible pathogenic agents that cause a variety of neurodegenerative diseases of humans and animals, including sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease in humans. They are unlike any other infectious pathogens because they are composed of an abnormal conformational isoform of a normal cellular protein, the prion protein (PrP). Prions are extremely resistant to inactivation by sterilization processes and disinfecting agents. Process challenge device (PCD): item designed to simulate product to be sterilized and to constitute a defined challenge to the sterilization process and used to assess the effective performance of the process. A PCD is a challenge test pack or test tray that contains a biologic indicator, a Class 5 integrating indicator, or an enzyme-only indicator. QUAT: abbreviation for quaternary ammonium compound, a surface-active, water-soluble disinfecting substance that has four carbon atoms linked to a nitrogen atom through covalent bonds. Last update: June 2024 102 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Recommended exposure limit (REL): occupational exposure limit recommended by NIOSH as being protective of worker health and safety over a working lifetime. Frequently expressed as a 40-hour time- weighted-average exposure for up to 10 hours per day during a 40-work week. Reprocess: method to ensure proper disinfection or sterilization; can include: cleaning, inspection, wrapping, sterilizing, and storing. Sanitizer: agent that reduces the number of bacterial contaminants to safe levels as judged by public health requirements. Commonly used with substances applied to inanimate objects. According to the protocol for the official sanitizer test, a sanitizer is a chemical that kills 99.999% of the specific test bacteria in 30 seconds under the conditions of the test. Shelf life: length of time an undiluted or use dilution of a product can remain active and effective. Also refers to the length of time a sterilized product (e.g., sterile instrument set) is expected to remain sterile. Spaulding classification: strategy for reprocessing contaminated medical devices. The system classifies a medical device as critical, semicritical, or noncritical on the basis of risk to patient safety from contamination on a device.

Spore: relatively water-poor round or elliptical resting cell consisting of condensed cytoplasm and nucleus surrounded by an impervious cell wall or coat. Spores are relatively resistant to disinfectant and sterilant activity and drying conditions (specifically in the genera Bacillus and Clostridium). Spore strip: paper strip impregnated with a known population of spores that meets the definition of biological indicators. Steam quality: steam characteristic reflecting the dryness fraction (weight of dry steam in a mixture of dry saturated steam and entrained water) and the level of noncondensable gas (air or other gas that will not condense under the conditions of temperature and pressure used during the sterilization process). The dryness fraction (i.e., the proportion of completely dry steam in the steam being considered) should not fall below 97%. Steam sterilization: sterilization process that uses saturated steam under pressure for a specified exposure time and at a specified temperature, as the sterilizing agent. Steam sterilization, dynamic air removal type: one of two types of sterilization cycles in which air is removed from the chamber and the load by a series of pressure and vacuum excursions (prevacuum cycle) or by a series of steam flushes and pressure pulses above atmospheric pressure (steam-flush- pressure-pulse cycle). Sterile or Sterility: state of being free from all living microorganisms. In practice, usually described as a probability function, e.g., as the probability of a microorganism surviving sterilization being one in one million. Sterility assurance level (SAL): probability of a viable microorganism being present on a product unit after sterilization. Usually expressed as 10–6; a SAL of 10-6 means ≤1/1 million chance that a single viable microorganism is present on a sterilized item. A SAL of 10-6 generally is accepted as appropriate for items intended to contact compromised tissue (i.e., tissue that has lost the integrity of the natural body barriers). The sterilizer manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the sterilizer can achieve the desired SAL. The user is responsible for monitoring the performance of the sterilizer to ensure it is operating in conformance to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Last update: June 2024 103 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Sterilization: validated process used to render a product free of all forms of viable microorganisms. In a sterilization process, the presence of microorganisms on any individual item can be expressed in terms of probability. Although this probability can be reduced to a very low number, it can never be reduced to zero. Sterilization area: area of a health-care facility designed to house sterilization equipment, such as steam ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, or ozone sterilizers.

Sterilization area: area of a health-care facility designed to house sterilization equipment, such as steam ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, or ozone sterilizers. Sterilizer: apparatus used to sterilize medical devices, equipment, or supplies by direct exposure to the sterilizing agent. Sterilizer, gravity-displacement type: type of steam sterilizer in which incoming steam displaces residual air through a port or drain in or near the bottom (usually) of the sterilizer chamber. Typical operating temperatures are 121–123°C (250–254°F) and 132–135°C (270–275°F). Sterilizer, prevacuum type: type of steam sterilizer that depends on one or more pressure and vacuum excursions at the beginning of the cycle to remove air. This method of operation results in shorter cycle times for wrapped items because of the rapid removal of air from the chamber and the load by the vacuum system and because of the usually higher operating temperature (132–135°C [270–275°F]; 141– 144°C [285–291°F]). This type of sterilizer generally provides for shorter exposure time and accelerated drying of fabric loads by pulling a further vacuum at the end of the sterilizing cycle. Sterilizer, steam-flush pressure-pulse type: type of sterilizer in which a repeated sequence consisting of a steam flush and a pressure pulse removes air from the sterilizing chamber and processed materials using steam at above atmospheric pressure (no vacuum is required). Like a prevacuum sterilizer, a steam-flush pressure-pulse sterilizer rapidly removes air from the sterilizing chamber and wrapped items; however, the system is not susceptible to air leaks because air is removed with the sterilizing chamber pressure at above atmospheric pressure. Typical operating temperatures are 121–123°C (250–254°F), 132–135°C (270–275°F), and 141–144°C (285–291°F). Surfactant: agent that reduces the surface tension of water or the tension at the interface between water and another liquid; a wetting agent found in many sterilants and disinfectants. Tabletop steam sterilizer: a compact gravity-displacement steam sterilizer that has a chamber volume of not more than 2 cubic feet and that generates its own steam when distilled or deionized water is added. Time-weighted average (TWA): an average of all the concentrations of a chemical to which a worker has been exposed during a specific sampling time, reported as an average over the sampling time. For example, the permissible exposure limit for ethylene oxide is 1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. Exposures above the ppm limit are permitted if they are compensated for by equal or longer exposures below the limit during the 8-hour workday as long as they do not exceed the ceiling limit; short-term exposure limit; or, in the case of ethylene oxide, excursion limit of 5 ppm averaged over a 15-minute sampling period. Tuberculocide: an EPA-classified hospital disinfectant that also kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tubercle bacilli). EPA has registered approximately 200 tuberculocides. Such agents also are called mycobactericides. Use-life: the length of time a diluted product can remain active and effective.

Follow the Last update: June 2024 111 of 163 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) FDA-cleared high-level disinfection claim. Ten-minute exposure is not adequate to disinfect many objects, especially those that are difficult to clean because they have narrow channels or other areas that can harbor organic material and bacteria. Twenty-minute exposure at 20°C is the minimum time needed to reliably kill M. tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria with a 2% glutaraldehyde. Some high-level disinfectants have a reduced exposure time (e.g., ortho-phthalaldehyde at 12 minutes at 20°C) because of their rapid activity against mycobacteria or reduced exposure time due to increased mycobactericidal activity at elevated temperature (e.g., 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 5 minutes at 35°C, 0.55% OPA at 5 min at 25°C in automated endoscope reprocessor). 3 Tubing must be completely filled for high-level disinfection and liquid chemical sterilization; care must be taken to avoid entrapment of air bubbles during immersion. 4 Material compatibility should be investigated when appropriate. 5 A concentration of 1000 ppm available chlorine should be considered where cultures or concentrated preparations of microorganisms have spilled (5.25% to 6.15% household bleach diluted 1:50 provides > 1000 ppm available chlorine). This solution may corrode some surfaces. 6 Pasteurization (washer-disinfector) of respiratory therapy or anesthesia equipment is a recognized alternative to high- level disinfection. Some data challenge the efficacy of some pasteurization units. 7 Thermostability should be investigated when appropriate. 8 Do not mix rectal and oral thermometers at any stage of handling or processing. 9 By law, all applicable label instructions on EPA-registered products must be followed. If the user selects exposure conditions that differ from those on the EPA-registered products label, the user assumes liability from any injuries resulting from off-label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under FIFRA.

Epidemiologic evidence associated with the use of surface disinfectants or detergents on noncritical environmental surfaces Justification for Use of Disinfectants for Noncritical Environmental Surfaces - Surfaces may contribute to transmission of epidemiologically important microbes (e.g., vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, viruses) - Disinfectants are needed for surfaces contaminated by blood and other potentially infective material - Disinfectants are more effective than detergents in reducing microbial load on floors - Detergents become contaminated and result in seeding the patient’s environment with bacteria - Disinfection of noncritical equipment and surfaces is recommended for patients on isolation precautions by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. - Advantage of using a single product for decontamination of noncritical surfaces, both floors and equipment - Some newer disinfectants have persistent antimicrobial activity Justification for Using a Detergent on Noncritical Environmental Surfaces - Noncritical surfaces contribute minimally to endemic healthcare-associated infections - No difference in healthcare-associated infection rates when floors are cleaned with detergent versus disinfectant - No environmental impact (aquatic or terrestrial) issues with disposal - No occupational health exposure issues - Lower costs - Use of antiseptics/disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant bacteria (?) - More aesthetically pleasing floor Modified from Rutala378.

Factors affecting the efficacy of sterilization Factors Effect Cleaning1 Failure to adequately clean instrument results in higher bioburden, protein load, and salt concentration. These will decrease sterilization efficacy. Bioburden1 The natural bioburden of used surgical devices is 100 to 103 organisms (primarily vegetative bacteria), which is substantially below the 105-106 spores used with biological indicators. Pathogen type Spore-forming organisms are most resistant to sterilization and are the test organisms required for FDA clearance. However, the contaminating microflora on used surgical instruments consists mainly of vegetative bacteria. Protein1 Residual protein decreases efficacy of sterilization. However, cleaning appears to rapidly remove protein load. Salt1 Residual salt decreases efficacy of sterilization more than does protein load. However, cleaning appears to rapidly remove salt load. Biofilm accumulation1 Biofilm accumulation reduces efficacy of sterilization by impairing exposure of the sterilant to the microbial cell. Lumen length Increasing lumen length impairs sterilant penetration. May require forced flow through lumen to achieve sterilization. Lumen diameter Decreasing lumen diameter impairs sterilant penetration. May require forced flow through lumen to achieve sterilization. Restricted flow Sterilant must come into contact with microorganisms. Device designs that prevent or inhibit this contact (e.g., sharp bends, blind lumens) will decrease sterilization efficacy. Device design and Materials used in construction may affect compatibility with different sterilization processes construction and affect sterilization efficacy. Design issues (e.g., screws, hinges) will also affect sterilization efficacy.

Suggested protocol for management of positive biological indicator in a steam sterilizer Format Change [February 2017]: The format of this section was changed to improve readability and accessibility. The content is unchanged. 1. Take the sterilizer out of service. Notify area supervisor and infection control department. 2. Objects, other than implantable objects, do not need to be recalled because of a single positive spore test unless the sterilizer or the sterilization procedure is defective. As soon as possible, repeat biological indicator test in three consecutive sterilizer cycles. If additional spore tests remain positive, the items should be considered nonsterile, and supplies processed since the last acceptable (negative) biological indicator should be recalled. The items from the suspect load(s) should be recalled and reprocessed. 3. Check to ensure the sterilizer was used correctly (e.g., verify correct time and temperature setting). If not, repeat using appropriate settings and recall and reprocess all inadequately processed items. 4. Check with hospital maintenance for irregularities (e.g., electrical) or changes in the hospital steam supply (i.e., from standard ≥97% steam, <3% moisture). Any abnormalities should be reported to the person who performs sterilizer maintenance (e.g., medical engineering, sterilizer manufacturer). 5. Check to ensure the correct biological indicator was used and appropriately interpreted. If not, repeat using appropriate settings. 6.

If one or both biological indicators are positive, do one or more of the following until problem is resolved. A. Request an inspection of the equipment by sterilizer maintenance personnel. B. Have hospital maintenance inspect the steam supply lines. C. Discuss the abnormalities with the sterilizer manufacturer. D. Repeat the biological indicator using a different manufacturer’s indicator. If step 7 does not resolve the problem Close sterilizer down until the manufacturer can assure that it is operating properly. Retest at that time with biological indicators in three consecutive sterilizer cycles. Modified from Bryce. 839 Disclosure of Financial Interests and Relationships (2000- July 2004) William A.

If you’re interested in preventing type 2 diabetes, this guide can help you get started. Congratulations on taking the first step! By reading this, you’re already on your way. Prediabetes puts you on the road to possibly getting type 2 diabetes. Find out now, in less than 1 minute, if you may have prediabetes by taking the Prediabetes Risk Test: https://www.cdc.gov/prediabetes/takethetest/ How did it go? If your result shows you’re at high risk for type 2 diabetes, talk to your doctor about getting a simple blood sugar test to confirm it. Then, if you’re diagnosed with prediabetes, consider joining a lifestyle change program offered by the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP). This program is proven to cut the risk for type 2 diabetes in half. You can find out more at CDC’s Lifestyle Change Program website: https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/lifestyle-change-program/ Not quite ready to join a lifestyle change program? Use this guide to help you take the first steps toward preventing type 2 diabetes. Why is prevention so important? Because type 2 diabetes is a serious, chronic health condition that can lead to other serious health issues such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, and kidney failure. If you can prevent or even delay getting type 2 diabetes, you can lower your risk for all those other conditions. That’s a pretty great deal. This guide will help you take small, practical steps that add up to a healthy lifestyle you can stick with and enjoy, including: ✔ Starting point: What’s motivating you start this journey? What new version of yourself are you trying to create? ✔ First stop: Set a weight loss goal. ✔ Second stop: Make a nutrition plan for healthier eating. ✓ Develop winning lifestyle habits. ✓ Master the skills of food measurement. ✓ Choose the best foods. ✓ Make work, home, grocery stores, and restaurants work for you. ✔ Keep moving: Set a physical activity goal for healthier movement. ✔ Track your progress: Watch yourself succeed with a few easy steps. ✔ Prepare for the long run: Recognize the support you have to keep you going. 1 By making some healthy changes, including eating healthier and getting active, you can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and improve your physical and mental health overall. And you don’t have to wait to feel the benefits—when you start making healthy changes, you get rewards right away. After taking just one walk, your blood sugar goes down. Make physical activity a habit and see how your sleep improves. Enjoy the taste of fresh, healthy food. Figure out what to do with all of your extra energy. Maybe even get closer to friends and family if you invite them along for the ride! A little background. What is prediabetes?

Prediabetes is really a wake-up But the good news is prediabetes can be call to turn things around, get healthier, reversed! And this guide will help to teach and not get type 2 diabetes you the basics. down the road. Considering joining a lifestyle change program? A CDC-recognized National DPP lifestyle change program is the gold standard for preventing type 2 diabetes. A trained lifestyle coach helps guide you to make healthy changes that can cut your type 2 diabetes risk in half. You also have a support group of other people who have similar goals and challenges. This guide can’t substitute for this lifestyle change program. But if you can’t join one right now, or if you want a jumpstart before your program begins, we can help you get going. 2 Starting Point: What’s motivating you to take this journey? What new version of yourself are you trying to create? For example, you might say that you want to be more active so you can keep up with your kids or grandkids. Now that you’ve reminded yourself of why you want to create new habits, let’s review how to create an action plan to help you build a new helpful routine. Step 1: Figure out what needs to change. The first step is finding a routine to change for the better. Let’s assess where you stand right now when it comes to nutrition and physical activity. Write down your answers to these questions to make it easier for you to figure out which of your habits are helpful and which habits you might want to work on.

What makes it easier for you to eat What makes it easier or more enjoyable healthier? for you to move more? What makes it harder? What makes it harder? Step 2: Plan a new routine. Starting a new routine helps you make a positive change that will stick. Be specific and realistic. Plan small changes to your routines instead of big changes that are hard to stick with. Step 3: Find a cue or hint for when to use your new routine. Your cue could be one of these: ✔ A specific time or place ✔ Other people in your life ✔ A feeling or emotion ✔ An action right before or right after a regular routine Make your new routine easy and the old one harder. Change your environment to support the new routine. Add or remove visual hints, such as adding a picture of you walking the dog on your phone screen or putting the kids’ snacks in the cupboard. Decide how you can make this new routine more rewarding. Connect a new routine to something fun, like only listening to your favorite band when taking the stairs, keeping track of the number of floors climbed, or doing your activity with a friend. Consider long-term rewards after meeting goals, like new walking shoes or a healthy meal out at your favorite restaurant. Create opportunities to repeat and practice your new routine until it becomes automatic. I am going to add a stair climb every day just before my morning coffee break. 4 First Stop: Set a Weight Loss Goal With your starting point in mind, set a weight loss goal. If you are overweight and have prediabetes, shedding just 5% of your weight can help reverse prediabetes. You may not be able to lose 5% of your body weight, but by eating well and being more active, you may be able to lower your HbA1C, or just A1C. You have options to be successful. What is HbA1C? The A1C, or hemoglobin (Hb) A1C, test is one of the commonly used tests to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes. It’s a simple blood test you get from a health care provider that measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. A normal A1C level is below 5.7%, a level of 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes, and a level of 6.5% or more indicates diabetes. Within the prediabetes range, the higher your A1C, the greater your risk is for developing type 2 diabetes. Ask your health", "page_start": 5, "page_end": 6, "source": "CDC", "document": "On-your-way-to-preventing-type-2-diabetes.pdf"}

Here’s an example to help calculate a weight loss goal of 5%. Action Example Weigh yourself first thing in the morning 240 pounds for the most accurate results and record the number. Determine 5% of your current weight. Take off last digit of your weight: 24 Divide in half: 12 To lose 5%, a 240-pound person would need to lose 12 pounds. Subtract that number from your current 240 - 12 = 228 weight to determine your goal weight. A 240-pound person’s goal weight would be 228 pounds. Now it’s your turn. Calculate your personal weight loss goal here: My current weight is pounds. 5% of my weight is pounds. My goal is to lose pounds, for a goal weight of pounds. Now that you’ve assessed your habits and preferences around eating and being active and have set a healthy weight loss goal, you’re better prepared to hit the road on your way to wellness. The following pages will help you improve your current habits, gain new ones, and set yourself up for success. 5 Second Stop: Make a Nutrition Plan for Healthier Eating Winning Habits: Make over your meals with a plan, the right ingredients, and life hacks. Make a plan. You’ve probably noticed that someone who follows a popular diet plan might quickly lose weight, but has a hard time keeping it off long term. This is common and discouraging, so let’s design a plan that you can follow for life. It doesn’t need to be popular or have a name. Your plan only needs two key ingredients to work: 1. It should be based on healthy eating. 2. It should be something you can keep doing. People often need to try different things to create a plan that works for them. Some may cut back on sugar and eat more protein to stay fuller longer. Others may focus on crowding out unhealthy food with extra fruits and vegetables. Still others take the guesswork and temptation out of life by sticking to just a few breakfast and lunch choices that they know are nutritious. The details will depend on what you like and what fits in best with your life. Eat well. Good food in the right amounts does so much more for you than just helping you lose the pounds; it helps you feel better and even think better. All good things!

Healthy eating is good for everyone! 7 Master the Skills of Food Measurement: Portion Sizes and Food Labels Size it up: get a handle on portion size. Most of us don’t know just how much we’re eating. One way to help manage portion size is by using the plate method. Using a basic 9-inch dinner plate: Fill one quarter with with a lean protein, such as Fill half of your plate chicken, turkey, beans, with non-starchy nuts, tofu, or eggs. vegetables, such as Fill one quarter of lettuce, tomatoes, the plate with grains green beans, carrots, or and starchy foods like broccoli, and fruits, such potatoes and oatmeal. as apples, grapefruit, or Or skip the starch and pears. double up on non-starchy veggies. You can have as many non-starchy veggies as you want as long as they’re not covered with Choose water or a low-calorie drink such as sauces, butter, or cheese. unsweetened iced tea to go with your meal. We don’t always eat off a plate, right? We eat out of bowls, fast-food packaging, or takeout boxes and containers. However, it’s really the same idea. You want to make sure your meal has a good proportion of vegetables, not too much fat, and not too many starchy foods. If you’re not using a plate, this “handy” guide will help you estimate portion size: 2 1. 3 ounces of meat, fish, or poultry Palm of hand (no fingers) 2. 1 cup or 1 medium fruit Fist 3. 1–2 ounces, 1⁄4 cup of nuts 5 4 or pretzels 1 Cupped hand 4. 1 tablespoon 3 Thumb (tip to base) 5. 1 teaspoon Thumb tip (tip to 1st joint) 8 Choose the Best Foods: Decoding Food Labels, Eating a Healthy Variety, and Quality Calories Put foods that don’t have labels first on your grocery list. Visit the produce section to stock up on fresh veggies and fruit. (Just watch out for packaged food tucked away between the apples and asparagus, such as salad toppings and snack foods.) Then, shop the outside aisles of the store for dairy, eggs, and lean meat. Some packaged food will be on your list. Use the Nutrition Facts label to see how many calories and grams of carbs, sugars, and fat are in the food you choose. This package has 4 Check the serving size servings. If you eat the first.

Our bodies are made to move, and we feel better when we do. That said, getting started can be a challenge. One thing is for sure—you won’t stick with something that you don’t like doing, and you shouldn’t have to. There are lots of ways to get moving; for example, walking is a great physical activity, and just about anyone can do it. Just be sure to check with your doctor about which activities are best for you and if there are any you should avoid. So, set a goal that works for you! And gradually work up to being active at a moderate intensity at least 150 minutes per week. One way to do this is to aim for 30 minutes, 5 days a week.
